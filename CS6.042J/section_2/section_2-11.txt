Stable Matching
Reading
  Let's look at another man/woman matching problem
  Each person has preferences about who to marry
    Man has preference list of women and vice versa
    Preferences are not symmetric
  The goal: marry everyone, no polygamy
  Want it to be "stable"
    No pair of people who prefer one another to their spouses
  In any matching
    Not married but both like each other better than spouses = "rogue couple"
    If no rogue couples, no affairs
  A "stable matching" is a matching with no rogue couples
  Turns out there is always a stable matching among men/women
  But among "buddies" who can all match, may not be possible
  The Mating Ritual
    Every day, the man stands under the balcony of top choice among women
      If he has no women left, he stays home and does math
    Then each woman tells favorite suitor to stick around
      Anyone told to leave crosses off preference list
    When every woman has at most one suitor, each marries
    Facts to prove
      Ritual eventually terminates
      Everybody ends up married
      Resulting marriages are stable
  Akamai
    Used variation of mating ritual to assign web traffic to servers
      Early used other combinatorial optimization algorithms
      Requests correspond to women, web servers correspond to men
      Requests have preferences based on latency and packet loss
      Servers have preferences based on cost of bandwidth and co-location
  Proof
    There is a marriage day
      Every day on which has not terminated, at least one man crosses a woman off
      (Because if not terminated, one woman serenaded by two men)
      Initially n^2 preferences, ritual can continue for at most n^2 days
        (Or less if each list winds up with at least one name - JM)
    Everyone winds up married
      If a woman has a suitor, will have her favorite tomorrow
        So next day chooses someone as desirable as favorite
        Favorite suitor gets better or stays the same, never worse
          Preserved invariant
      If w is crossed off m's list, then w has a suitor she prefers over m
      Invariant P holds vacuously at the beginning, no women crossed off to start
      Assume to contrary that on last day of mating ritual Bob is unmarried
        Not serenading anybody, list is empty
        Every woman must have been crossed off his list
        Every woman has a suitor she prefers to Bob
        So every woman has a suitor, and it's only one, and they marry
        But equal number of men and women, so if all women marry so do men
        Contradicts assumption Bob is not married
    Stable matching
      Any couple that are not married, prove that not rogue couple
      Case 1 - Jen is not on Brad's list by the end - then Jen has husband prefer to Brad
      Case 2 - Jen is on Brad's list - wife must be higher on preference list than Jen
  Who is favored by this ritual?
    Women seem to have power
      Choose favorite suitor and reject the rest
      Suitors only change for the better
      For men the women they serenade only get worse
    But they do not!
    Ritual produces a stable matching, but they need not be unique
    Reverse roles and you often get a different stable matching
    One person is a "feasible spouse" when there is a stable matching in which the two are married
    If w is crossed off m's list, then w is not a feasible spouse for m
    Lemma: this is a preserved invariant for the mating ritual
    Proof
      Suppose Q holds at some point in the Ritual
      Some woman Alice is about to be crossed off Bob's list
        Alice prefers Ted to Bob - and Ted is serenading Alice
        This means Alice is at the top of Ted's list
        So if Alice could be married to Bob, Ted would be married to someone he likes less
        Ted and Alice would be a rogue couple
      Definition
        Optimal spouse - most preferred feasible spouse
        Pessimal spouse - least preferred feasible spouse
      Thm
        Mating ritual marries every man to optimal spouse, every woman to pessimal spouse
        If Bob is married to Alice on final day of ritual
          Everyone above Alice was crossed off - not feasible
          Alice is Bob's highest ranked feasible spouse - that is, optimal
        Since Bob likes Alice better than any feasible wife
        Alice & Bob would be rogue couple if married to husband she likes less than Bob
          Bob must be Alice's least preferred husband
  Applications
    1962 Gale/Shapley paper
    But was already used 10 years earlier to match residents to hospitals
      Also used by at least one online large dating agency today

Lecture
  We've seen boy/girl connection graphs
  A similar problem comes up in terms of "stable matching"
    Matching up boys and girls in a way with constraints
  Setup
    5 boys, 5 girls to pair - each have a ranking of preferences
    Want to acknowledge preferences as much as we can
  Let's try a "greedy" strategy for boys
    Give the first boy top choice
    Then give the second boy top choice, etc
    But when we look at marriages
    Boy 1 is happy with girl C, but she may not be
    And boy 4 is married to girl B
      But boy 4 likes girl C more than girl B
      And girl C likes boy 4 more than boy 1
      Would be happier running off together
      "Rogue couple"
  Stable marriage problem
    Marry everyone without any rogue couples
      People may still not be happy, but doesn't matter
        Won't find anybody else that is unhappy in the same way, would run off with them
    Can you actually do this in real time?
      Used to actually do this in class
        Often worked but not always
    Solutions
      1. All girls get first choice - all girls have different first choice boys
        But that is unusual, isn't it?
      2. Another set not so obvious
        "Boy optimal" - every boy gets best possible spouse
        But is pessimal for girls - get worst possible spouse
  This is more than a puzzle
    College admissions (Gale & Shapley)
      Trying to match up
      Let's get a stable set of offers on the table
    Matching hospitals and residents (fka interns)
      Already in practice 20 years earlier, just not published
      Was a mess before discovered (ARM edited a whole series incl. a book on this)
        Huge measures for stability needed
    Matching clients and servers
      Akamai - providing cached webpages, respond quickly to local calls
        65k servers, 2B requests per day
        Requests = boys
        Servers = girls
        Large numbers - good thing this is amenable to running in parallel
    Used in an Indian dance group at MIT
  Stable Matching: The Mating Ritual
    Morning: boy serenades favorite girl
    Afternoon: girl rejects all but one
    Evening: boy crosses girl off if rejected
    Stop when no girl rejects
    Each girl marries her favorite suitor (if any)
      Stopping condition
    State Machine
  Stable Marriages
    Termination:
      There exists a wedding day
    Partial correctness:
      Everyone is married
      Marriages are stable
  Termination
    Total # of names remaining on boys' lists
      Strictly decreasing and N valued - (eh? contradicted by class Q and my own reasoning - JM)
      Will reach a minimum value, that's when the algorithm stops
      So there exists Wedding Day
    Correctness
      Girls improve day by day
        Favorite tomorrow will be at least as desirable as today
        Because favorite will stay until she rejects him for someone better
        Lemma
          The rank of a girl's favorite is weakly increasing
        Lemma
          The boy's favorite will be no more desirable, works down list
          Rank of girl a boy serenades is weakly decreasing
      Mating Ritual invariant
        If G is not on B's list, she has a better current favorite
        When G rejected B she had a better suitor, and her favorites never get worse
      On wedding day
        Each girl has <= 1 suitor (by def of wedding day)
        Each boy is married or has no girls on his list
          Either is serenading, or has no girls on his list
          No bigamy, no husband sharing
          Boys serenade one girl at a time
      Everyone is married on wedding day, proof by contradiction
        Suppose B is not married, his list is empty
        By invariant, all girls have favorites better than B
        All girls are married
        Since no bigamy, all boys are married
      Stability
        Two cases, both trivial from invariant
        Bob won't be in rogue couple with
          case 1: a girl G on his final list
            He's already married to the best of them
          case 2: a girl G not on his list
            She's married to someone she likes better
        Bob can't be in a rogue couple with anyone
  Optimal Stable Matching
    Basic stability has value, doesn't mean everybody's happy
    Just means nobody can find someone equally unhappy to run off with
    How well do people do using the mating ritual (and other options)
    Who does better, boys or girls?
      Girls suitors get better over time (sounds good)
      Boys sweethearts get worse
      So do girls do better? No!
      Why? Boys start off with first choice
      They go down but only to best woman they can be married to
    Nicole is optimal for Keith when highest ranked girl he can stably marry
      He might like someone else more
      But if he's not married to her, there's no way she's interested
    Mating ritual is optimal for all boys at once
      You'd think optimality is sacrificed for other boys, but not
      And girls get pessimal spouse
    Proof that mating ritual leads to boy optimal marriages
      By contradiction
      Say Nicole is optimal for Keith
      And Keith does not marry Nicole
      He must have crossed off Nicole on some earlier "bad" day
      Assume Keith had the earliest bad day
      On his bad day, Nicole rejected because she liked her suitor Tom better
      And Tom has not crossed off his optimal girl yet
        So Nicole is >= optimal for Tom
      Nicole is >= optimal for Tom
      Nicole prefers =Tom to Keith
      So in any set of stable marriages with Nicole married to Keith
        Tom will be married to someone he like someone less
        And Nicole will be married to Keith who she likes less than Tom
        Nicole and Tom would be rogue
        Contradicts fact that Nicole is optimal for Keith
          Marriage is not stable
    Proof that girl pessimal, simpler but similar
  Are other stable marriages possible?
    Can switch roles of girls and boys for starters
      Girl-optimal, boy-pessimal
      (Could be same in rare cases)
    But are there others the mating ritual doesn't find?
      Can be many - if n boys/girls could be exponential in n
    What would be the best? Big question
    Do better by lying?
      Instead of following protocol
      Boys - No! already optimal
      Girls - Yes! if conspire together to lie can reach girl-optimal
        Are there protocols resistant to lying - another question
      Book - Gusfield and Irving
  Bipartite matching
    Mating Ritual one example of this
    Bipartite graph
      Simple graph, vertices split into 2 groups
      Edges - compatibility constraints
        Specification each girl willing to be paired with certain boys
        Match each girl to unique compatible boy
    Formally
      Want bijection from girls to boys that follows edges
    What about a case where can't find a match?
      3 girls compatible with just 2 boys, 1 girl compatible with another 2 boys
      "Bottleneck" - proves a match not possible
    Generally
      Set S on left and look at image E(S) on right - all boys compatible with 1+ girls in S
        |S| = 3, E|S| = 2
        Bottlenecked
        General definntion
        |S| > |E(S)|
    Lemma
      A set S of girls without enough boys
      E(S) ::= boys adjacent to at least one girl in S
      |S| > |E(S)|
      If there is a bottleneck, no match is possible, obviously
    Thm
      Conversely, if there are no bottlenecks, there is a match
      Hall's Thm - not obvious, but let's prove
  Hall's Thm
    Bipartite graph H
    The vertices H altogether are L(H) U R(H)
    Edges of H only go between L(H) and R(H)
  Bipartite match
    Total injective function m : L(H) -> R(H) that follows edges
      So every L vertex has a match on the other side
    If |S| <= |E(S)| for all sets S C= L(H) then there is a match
    How to verify no bottlenecks? It's hard
      Need to check subsets of L(H)
    Fairly efficient matching procedure runs quadratically - learn in algorithms class
    There is a special situation that ensures a match
      Every girl likes >= d boys
      Every boy likes <= d girls
      A degree-constrained graph
      Min degree girls >= max degree boys
    Degree constrained bipartite graph satisfies Hall's condition
      Every girl likes >= d boys
      Every boy likes <= d girls
      No bottlenecks
      Proof
        Say set S of girls has e incident edges
         d * |S| <= e <= d * |E(S)|
         Cancel d's
        So |S| < |E(S)|
          No bottleneck QED
    Many graphs with matches that are not degree-constrained
      Just comes up often
    Proving Hall's Theorem
      No bottleneck, then there is a match
      Suppose no bottlenecks
      Lemma: no bottlenecks in any set S of girls
        No subset will have a bottleneck
      Lemma: if S a set of girls with |S| = |E(S)|
        Then no bottlenecks between NOT(S) and NOT(E(S)) either
      Suppose set T subset of NOT(E(S))
        Taking T and image of T not in E(S)
      No bottlenecks implies there is a perfect match
      By strong induction on the number of girls
      Case 1
        Proper subset of girls with |S| = |E(S)|
        By Lemmas, no bottlenecks in Hall graph (S, E(S)), and none in (NOT(S), NOT(E(S))
        If no bottlenecks overall, no bottlenecks in restricted graphs
        Matchings don't overlap, so union is a complete matching
          Working subsets by themselves
      Case 2
        |S| < |E(S)| for all nonempty proper subsets S
        Now you've got slack - pick girl g, must be compatible with one boy since no bottlenecks
        Arbitrarily match her
        Removing b still leaves |S| <= |E(S)| so no bottlenecks
        By induction can match remaining girls and boys
        That match along with g-b is a complete match - QED
