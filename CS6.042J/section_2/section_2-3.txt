Euler's Theorem
Lecture
  For n > 0, define
  phi(n) ::= the number of integers in [0,n) that are relatively prime to n
    "Euler's phi function"
  phi(7) = 6 because all positive numbers in [0..7) are relatively prime to n
    Only 0 is not relatively prime to 7
  phi(12) = 4 (1, 5, 7, 11)
  If p is prime
    phi(p) = p - 1
      every positive number in [0,p) is relatively prime to p
  When n is composite
    phi gets complicated (back to it soon)
  Euler's Thm in terms of convergence
    if n and k are relatively prime, then
      k^phi(n) === 1 (mod n)
  JM tests
    k = 6, n = 7 k and n are relatively prime
      6^phi(n) === 1 (mod n)
      6^6 === 1 (mod 7)
      46656 = 1 (mod 7) - true checked with google calc
    k = 7, n = 12
      7^4 === 1 (mod 12)
      2401 === 1 (mod 12) yep, can see that easily

    The Riemann hypothesis
      Formula for sum of infinite geometric series:
        1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + ... = 1 / (1 - x)
      Substituting 1/(2^s), 1/(3^s), 1/(5^s) for each prime number
        1 + 1/(2^s) + 1/(2^2s), 1/(2^3s) + ... = 1 / (1 - 1/2^s)
        1 + 1/(3^s) + 1/(3^2s), 1/(3^3s) + ... = 1 / (1 - 1/3^s)
        1 + 1/(5^s) + 1/(5^2s), 1/(5^3s) + ... = 1 / (1 - 1/5^s)
      Multiplying to together right and left sides
        sum(n = 1; inf) 1/(n^s) = phi p in primces (1 / (1 - 1/p^s))
        s is a complex number, left side as a function snake(s)
        distribution of primes is related to values of s for which snake(s) = 0
      Riemann hypothesis:
        Every nontrivial zero of the zeta function snake(s) lies on the line s = 1/2 + ci in the complex plane
        A proof immediately implies a strong form of the Prime Number Theorem
          Another $1m prize for this
  Rephrase Euler's Thm in terms of Zn
    Let Zn* be the integers in (0..n) that are relatively prime to n
    Zn* ::= { k in (0..n) | gcd(k, n) = 1 }
    so phi(n) = |Zn*|
    Euler's theorem for Zn
      for all k in Zn*
        so all relative primes to n - JM
      k^phi(n) = 1 (Zn)
        restating of original formula - JM
    Follows from 2 lemmas
      First, Zn* is closed under multiplication in Zn
        if j, k in Zn*, then j *n k in Zn*
          if 5 and 7 in Z*12, then rem(5 * 7, 12) -> 11 in Zn*
          if 5 and 11 in Z*12, then rem(5 * 7, 12) -> 7 in Zn*
          if 7 and 11 in Z*12, then rem(5 * 7, 12) -> 5 in Zn*
        Lots of easy ways to prove - not in text
      Definition, for any element k and subset S of Zn, let
        kS ::= {k *n s | s in S}
      If k in Zn* and S =C Zn
        |kS| = |S|
      Proof
        Since k in Zn*, it is cancellable
          [ks = kt(Zn)] implies s = t
        So multiplying by k in Zn maps all the elements of S to distinct elements of kS
        Which implies S and kS are the same size
    Corollary
      if k in Zn*
        kZn* = Zn*
    Proof of Euler's theorem
      Let P ::= k1 * k2 ... k(phi(n)) (Zn)
      be the product of all the numbers in Zn*
      Let Q ::= (k * k1) * (k * k2) ... (k * k(phi(n))) (Zn)
      for k in Zn*
      Factoring out ks immediately gives
        Q = k^(phi(n))P (Zn)
      But Q is the same as the product of the numbers in kZn* = Zn*
      So Q is the product of the same numbers of P, just in a different order
      P = Q = k^phi(n)P = Z(n)
      P in Zn*, so can be cancelled
      1 = k^phi(n) (Zn)
    Another way to find inverses modulo n
       if k is relatively prime to n
       k^(phi(n) - 1) is a Zn inverse of k
       Can compute efficiently via fast exponentiation
       But must compute phi(n)
        Easy if we know prime factorization of n
        But hard to do when n is large
        Pulverizer remains best approach
    Fermat's Little Theorem
      Suppose p is a prime and k is not a multiple of p
        k^(p - 1) === 1 (mod p)
    Computing Euler's phi function
      RSA works using arithmetic modulo the product of two large primes
      First, how do we compute phi(pq) for primes p and q
        phi(pq) = (p - 1)(q - 1)
        for primes p != q
      Proof:
        p and q are primes, so any number not relatively prime to pq
        Must be a multiple of p or a multiple of q.
        Among the pq numbers in [0..pq)
          There are q multiples of p and p mulitples of q
          Since p and q are relatively pirme, only number in [0..pq)
            that is a multiple of BOTH p and q is 0
          So there are p + q - 1 numbers in [0..pq) that are NOT relatively prime to n
        phi(pq) = pq - (p + q - 1)
                all nums under pq except for multiples of p and q, except for 0 - JM
                = (p - 1)(q - 1)
        how to calculate phi(n) for arbitrary n
          a) if p is a prime then phi(p^k) = p^k - p^k-1 for a k >= 1
          b) if a and b are relatively prime, phi(ab) = phi(a)phi(b)
        example
          phi(300) = phi(2^2 * 3 * 5^2)
                   = phi(2^2) * phi(3) * phi(5^2)
                   = (2^2 - 2^1)(3^1 - 3^0)(5^2 - 5^1)
                   = 2 * 2 * 20
                   = 80
        Why?
          Every pth number among the p^k in [0..p^k) is divisible by p
            And ONLY these are divisible by p
            So 1/p of these numbers are divsible by p and the remaining are not
            phi(p^k) = p^k - 1/p*p^k = p^k - p^(k - 1)
        Corollary
          For any number n, if p1, p2,... pj are the distinct prime factors of n
          phi(n)= n(1 - 1/p1)(1 - 1/p2)...(1 - 1/pj)

Lecture
  phi(n) ::= #k in 0, 1, ... n - 1 such that k rel prime to n
  phi(n) ::= #k in [0, 1) s.t. gcd(k, n) = 1
  Let's define that set of numbers we're interested in
    gcd1{n} ::= {k in [0,n) | gcd(k, n) = 1}
  So phi(n) = |gcd1{n}| (some books write n*)
  gcd1{7} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
  phi(7) = 6
  gcd1{12} = {1, 5, 7, 11}
  phi(12) = 4
  Calculating phi
    if p is prime, everything [1, p) is prime to p
      phi(p) = p - 1
    phi(9)? rel prime to 9 iff rel.prime to 3
      {1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8}
    phi(9) = 6
  Calculating phi(p^k)
    0, 1, ... p ... 2p... p^k - p... p^k - 1
    p divides every pth number
    so 1/pth numbers in interval are bad
    phi(p^k) = p^k - p^k/p
    phi(p^k) = p^k - p^(k - 1)
  Calculating phi(a * b) - not a prime
    If a, b are relatively prime - "multiplicativity" - "Euler's Totient Function"
    Lemma:
      phi(a * b) = phi(a) * phi(b)
      proof is on Pset 5 (another proof way later by "counting")
    But let's just use this fact
    phi(12) = phi(3 * 4)
            = phi(3) * phi(4)
            = (3 - 1) * (2^2 - 2^(2-1))
            = 2 * 2 = 4
  Why are we examining phi?
    Euler's Theorem
      If k is relatively prime to n
      k^(phi(n)) === 1 (mod n)
  Problem
    remember they must be relatively prime for multiplicativity to work!
  The Ring Zn
    Another way to talk about congruence and arithmetic
    Work strictly with remainders
      Don't worry that the product of 2 remainders may be too big to be a remainder
      Number gets too big? Hit with a remainder operation to bring back in range
    That's the idea with Ring Zn
      Ring of integers modulo n
      The elements of Zn are the remainders - up to but not including n
    i + j (Zn) ::= rem(i + j, n)
    i * j (Zn) ::= rem(i * j, n)
    This makes some things easier to say - talking equality instead of congruence
    The integer interval [0,n) under + , * (Zn) is called Zn - the ring of integers mod n
  Zn arithmetic
    3 + 6 = 2 (Z7) - 3 + 6 = 9, remainder on division by 7 is 2
    9 * 8 = 6 (Z11)
  Z versus Zn
    r(k) abbrevs rem(k, n)
    r(i + j) = r(i) + r(j) (Zn)
    r(i * j) = r(i) * r(j) (Zn)
    "homomorphism relating Z to Zn"
    i === j (mod n) IFF
    r(i) = r(j) (Zn)
  Rules for Zn (don't need to memorize names - will hear in algebra courses)
    (i + j) + k = i + (j + k) associativity
    0 + i = i                 identity
    i + (-i) = 0              inverse
    i + j = j + i             commutativity
    (i * j) * k = i * (j * k) associativity
    1 * i = i                 identity
    i * j = j * i             commutativity
                              *no inverses, can't count on that
    i * (j + k) = i *j + i * k distributivity
    no cancellation rule
      3 * 2 = 8 * 2 (Z12)
      3 != 8 (Z12)
  Zn* = elements of Zn relatively prime to n
  i in Zn* IFF
    gcd(i, n) = 1 IFF
    i is cancellable in Zn IFF
    i has an inverse in Zn
    Give you the sense that Zn* is a robust subset of Zn
  phi(n) = |Zn*|
    remember phi(n) - number of relatively prime integers
    k^phi(n) = 1 Z(n)
      Raise a number k to the power phi(n) it equals 1 in Zn
        for k in Zn* (k relatively prime to n)
    Proof is actually pretty easy
      Lemma 1. |kS| = |S| for S =C Zn
        If you have a subset in Zn - multiply by k - same size by S
          Only true for k in Zn*
          Multiply by cancellable element - set of the same size
          s1 != s2 IMPLIES ks1 != ks2
      Lemma 2. For i, j in Zn
        i, j in Zn* IFF i * j in Zn*
        if neither i nor j have a factor in common with n, then their product does not either
        but their sum is NOT - usually get an element no longer relatively prime to n
      Corollary
        Zn* = kZn*
          for k in Zn* (k is cancellable)
          you get the same elements, just reordered - multiplication permutes the elements of Zn*
        Example, permuting Z9
          phi(9) = 3^2 - 3 = 6
          Z9* = 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8
          What if multiply them all by 2?
            2, 4, 8, 1, 5, 7
          Multiply by 7
            7, 5, 1, 8, 4, 2
      Now to prove Euler's Thm
        product(Zn*) = product(kZn*) // big pi = product (oh - JM)
        Let's multiply elements on both sides together
        How many elements are in Zn*? phi(n) - so k^(phi(n))
        product Zn* = k^phi(n) product(Zn*)
        product Zn* will be an element in Zn* that is cancellable
        1 = k^phi(n)
        QED
