Modular Arithmetic

  Congruence - idea from Gauss
    a is congruent to b (a === b)
    a is congruent to b modulo n if n | (a - b)
    29 === 15 (mod 7) because 29 - 15 = 14, divisible by 7
      7 | 29 - 15
    Assume moduli are > 1 from now on
    a === b mod(n) iff rem(a, n) = rem(b, n)
    Proof
      There exists unique pairs of ints q1, r1 and q2, r2 such that
        a = q1n + r1
        b = q2n + r2
      Where r1, r2 in [0..n)
      Subtracting equations gives
        a - b = (q1 - q2)n + (r1 - r2)
      Where r1 - r2 in interval (-n, n)
      a === b mod n iff n divides a - b
      so r1 - r2 must be a multiple of n
      But the only multiple of n in (-n, n) is 0
      So r1 - r2 = 0
      r1 ::= rem(a, n) = r2 ::= rem(b, n)
      29 === 15 mod 7 because rem(29, 7) = 1 = rem(15, 7)
    Remainder Lemma
      Congruence has properties like equality relation
      a === a (mod n)
      a === b IFF b === a (mod n)
      a === b and b === c IMPLIES a === c (mod n)
    Corollary
      a === rem(a, n) (mod n)
  Another way to think about congruence mod n
    Defines a partition of the integers into n sets so that congruent nums all in same sets
    Suppose working mod 3
      { -6, -3, 0, 3, 6, 9 }
      { -5, -2, 1, 4, 7, 10 }
      { -4, 1, 2, 5, 8, 11 }
    According to whether remainders on division by 3 are 0, 1, or 2
    When arithmetic done modulo n, only n different kinds of numbers to worry about
      Only n possible remainders
    So you could say modular arithmetic is a simplification (in a way... - JM)
  Congruences are preserved by addition and multiplication
    If a === b (mod n) and c === d (mod n)
    a + c === b + d (mod n)
    ac === bd (mod n)
    Proof
      Since a === b (mod n)
      n | (b - a) = (b + c) - (a + c)
      So a + c === b + c (mod n)
      Since c === d (mod n)
      b + c === b + d (mod n)
      Transitivity gives
      a + c === b + d (mod n)
    ~identical proof for ac === bd
      if n | b - a, then n | bc - ac
  Remainder arithmetic
    Congruence Lemma says two numbers are congruent iff their remainders are equal
    General principle
      To find remainder on division by n of the result of a series of additions and mults
      Replace each integer operand by its remainder on division by n
      Keep each result of add/mult in range [0..n) by replacing result outside range
        By remainder on division by n
      rem((44426^3456789 + 15555858^5555)403^6666666, 36)
      rem(44427, 36) = 3, rem(15555858, 36) = 6, rem (403, 36) = 7
      (3^3456789 + 6^5555)7^6666666
      Still a million digits in the first value but
      rem(3, 36) = 3
      rem(3^2, 36) = 9
      rem(3^3, 36) = 27
      rem(3^4, 36) = 9
      rem 9 every 2 steps
      rem(3^3456789, 36) = rem(3^3, 36) = 27
      Powers of 6 even easier
        6^2, 36 = 0, repeating after second step
      Powers of 7 repeat after 6 steps, but on 5th step get a 1
        rem(7^6, 36) = 1
      (3^3456789 + 6^5555)7^6666666
      (3^3 + 6^2 * 6^6553)(7^6)^1111111
      (3^3 + 0 * 6^5553)1^1111111
      (27 + 0) * 1
      27
      Would be a disastrous blunder to replace an exponent by its remainder
        Principle applies to operands of plus and times
        Exponent controls how many multiplications to perform
    The ring Zn
      Let's be more precise about general principle and why it works
      Notation: +n for doing an addition and then taking a remainder on division by n
        i+n j ::= rem(i + j, n)
        i*n j ::= rem(ij, n)

      General principle repeated application of following lemma
        rem(i + j, n) = rem(i, n)+n (rem j, n)
          rem(i + j, n) = rem(rem(i, n) + r(j, n), n) - JM
        rem(ij, n) = rem(i, n)*n rem(j, n)
          rem(ij, n) = rem(rem(i, n) * r(j, n), n) - JM
      Proof
        i === rem(i, n) and j === rem(j, n)
        i + j = rem(i, n) + rem(j, n) (mod n)
        remainders on each side are equal, so
        rem(i + j, n) = rem(i, n)+n (rem j, n)
      The set of integers in the range [0, n) together with +n and *n
        Referred to as Zn, the ring of integers modulo n
        So familiar rules of arithmetic hold in Zn
          (in * j)*nk = i*n(j*nk)
          (i * j) * k = i * (j * k) (Zn) // rewrite to clean up
           // so we're taking the remainder of division by n after each function
        All following equalities are true in Zn
          (i * j) * k = i * (j * k)
          (i + j) + k = i + (j + k)
          1 * k = k
          0 + k = k
          k + (-k) = 0
          i + j = j + i
          i * (j + k) = (i * j) + (i * k)
          i * j = j * i
        Note that sets with addition and multiplication ops that satisfy equalities
          Known as a commutative ring
          In addition to Zn, the integers, rationals, reals, and polynomials with integer coeffs all work
          But { T, F } does not
          Nor do n x n matrices - fail to satisfy one equality
        Overall remainder arithmetic a lot like ordinary arithmetic
        But there are a few key exceptions...
  Turing's Code, v2
    Germany lost because Enigma was broken by Polish Cipher Bureau in 1939
    Turing joined UK codebreaking at Bletchley Park in 1939
      Lead developer of methods for rapid bulk decryption
    Let's go back to his last idea
      Basic right idea - multiply message by key
      But it was a mistake to do conventional math instead of modular math
    Before:
      Sender and receiver agree on large number n, which may be public
        This will be the modulus for all our arithmetic
      Some prime number k < n is the secret key
    Encryption
      Message m is a prime in [0..n)
      m-hat = m * k (Zn)
        So m-hat = rem(m * k, n) - JM
    Decryption
      Uh-oh
      Might want to decrypt by dividing m-hat by key k
      But m-hat is the *remainder* when mk is divided by n
        So dividing m-hat by k might not even give us an integer
      Can be overcome with a better understanding of when to divide by k in modular arithmetic
  Multiplicative inverses and Cancelling
    Multiplicative inverse of a number x is a number x^-1 such that
      x^-1 * x = 1
      1/3 is the inverse of 3
      every rational number other than 1 has an inverse
        inverse of n/m is m/n
      but out of integers, only -1 and 1
      over the ring Zn?
      in Z15, 2 is an inverse of 8
        2 * 8 = 1 (Z15)
      but 3 does not have an inverse
        Prove by contradiction
          1 = 3 * j (Z15)
          5 = 5 * 3 * j
            = (5 * 3) * j
            = 0 * j = 0 (Z15)
        So no inverse j
      So some numbers have inverses mod 15 and some do not
    Relative Primality
      Integers with no prime factor in common = relatively prime
        Same as having no common divisor > 1, so gcd(a, b) = 1
      8 and 15 are relatively prime
        gcd(8, 15) = 1
      3 and 15 are not relatively prime
        gcd(3, 15) = 3 != 1
      Lemma: if k in [0..n) is relatively prime to n, then k has an inverse in Zn
      Proof: if k is relatively prime to n, then gcd(n, k) = 1
        Can use pulverizer to find sn + tk = 1
        (rem(s, n) * rem(n, ns) + rem(t, n) * rem(k, n)) = 1 (Zn)
        But rem(n, n) = 0 and rem(k, n) = k since k in [0..n)
        rem(t, n) * k = 1(Zn)
        Therefore rem(t, n) is a multiplicative inverse of k
      Lemma: if i and j are both inverses of k in Zn, then i = j
      Proof:
        i = i * 1 = i * (k * j) = (i * k) * j = 1 * j = j (Zn)
      So for any k relatively prime to n, the inverse of k in Zn
        Is the remainder of a coefficient we can find using the pulverizer
      Cancellation
        Real numbers are nice - ok to cancel common factors
        If we know tr = ts for real numbers r, s, t
          Then as long as t != 0 we can conclude r = s
        Cancellation is NOT valid in Zn
          3 * 10 = 3 * 5 (Z15)
          But cancelling the 3s leads to 10 = 5 (Z15) - no
          This is the most significant way Zn arithmetic differs for ordinary integer math
        A number is cancellable in Zn iff
          k * a = k * b implies a = b (Zn)
            for all (a, b) in [0..n)
        If a number is relatively prime in 15, can be cancelled by multiplying by inverse
          If k has an inverse in Zn, then it is cancellable
          3 is not relatively prime to 15, it is not cancellable in Z15
        Thm the following are equivalent for k in [0..n)
          gcd(k, n) = 1
          k has an inverse in Zn
          k is cancellable in Zn
      Decrypting
        Multiplicative inverses are key to decryption
          Recover original message by multiplying the encoded message by teh Zn inverse j of the key
          m-hat * j = (m * k) *j = m * (k * j) = m * 1 = m (Zn)
        So to decrypt just find in inverse of the secret k key, easy using pulverizer
          If k has an inverse
          But k is positive and < n
          So an easy way to ensure k is relatively prime is to make n a prime number
      Breaking Turing's code
        Germans transmitted both encoded and unencoded weather reports
          Figured out which key using on a given day
          Known-plaintext attack
        Suppose you know both m-hat and m
          m-hat = m * k (Zn)
          m is positive and less than prime n
          Use pulverizer to find Zn inverse j of m
          j * m-hat = j * (m * k) = (j * m) * k = 1 * k = k (Zn)
          So by computing j * m^hat = k (Zn) you get the key and can decrypt all

Lecture
  Idea created by Gauss in 18th century
  Remains an active field of application and research
  In computer science, used mostly in crypto
  Also plays a role in hashing - key for managing data in memory
    Will not go into that application in this course
  def: a === b mod (n)
    iff n | (a - b)
  example 30 === 12 (mod 9)
    9 | 30 - 12, i.e. 9 | 18
  example 66666663 === 788253 (mod 10)
    immediate application - subtract
    just do lowest order digits - xxxxxxx0
    So is divisible by 10
    Any numbers congruent mod 10 have same low order digit
  Remainder Lemma
    a === b (mod n) iff
    rem(a, n) = rem(b, n) (abbr. ran = rbn)
    30 === 12 (mod 9)
    rem(30, 9) = 3 = rem(12, 9)
  "Equivalent" same as "congruent"
  Proof of if
    a = qan + ran
    b = qbn + rbn
    if remainders are equal
    a - b = (qa - qb)n so n | (a - b)
  Proof of only if
    Assume n divides (a - b)
    n | ((qa - qb)n + (ran - rbn))
      n auto-divides (qa - qb)n
      so *must* divide (ran - rbn)
      but these remainders < 1, and distance between them 0 to -1
      well the only way that works is ran = rbn
      IMPLIES ran = rbn
      QED - Remainder Lemma proved
  Consequences of Remainder Lemma
    inherits a lot of properties
      symmetric
        a === b (mod n) implies b === a (mod n)
      transitive
        a === b and b ===c (mod n) IMPLIES a === c (mod n)
    corollary
      a === rem(a, n) (mod n)
      take remainder of both sides
      left is now rem(a, n)
      pf: 0 < ran < n so rem(rem(a, n)) = rem(a, n)
      allows us to basically replace numbers with their remainders whenever we want
        therefore keeping numbers small
  Congruence mod n
    if a === b (mod n)
      a + c === b + c (mod n)
    pf: n | (a - b)
        n | ((a + c) - (b + c))
    if a === b (mod n)
      ac = bc (mod n)
    pf: n | (a - b) implies
      n | (a - b) * c and so
      n | ((a * c) - (b * c))
    Corollary
      if a === b and c === d (mod n)
      a + c === b + d (mod n)
      a * c === b * d (mod n)
    Cor
      if a === a' (mod n)
      then replacing a by a' in any formula gives an === mod n formula
        final congruence result remains unchanged
    So a lot like ordinary arithmetic
    Important: congruence and a === rem(a, n) (mod n)
    keeps (mod n) arithmetic in the remainder range
      from 0 to n - 1 - [0, n)
    Apply
      287^9 = ? (mod 4)
      r(287, 4) = 3
      287^9 === 3^9
      = ((3^2)^2)^2 * 3
      but since r(9, 4) = 1
      = (1^2)^2 * 3
      = 3 (mod 4)
  Inverses mod n
    Where stuff is different: inverses, cancelling
    8 * 2 === 3 * 2 (mod 10)
    Cancel 2s?
      8 === 3 (mod 10) NOPE
    Can't cancel arbitrarily
    When can you cancel?
      When k has no common factors with n
      If gcd(k, n) = 1 then have k' - inverse of k
        k' * k = 1 (mod n)
      k' is an inverse mod n of k
    Proof: sk + tn = 1 so
      Just let k' be s - apply pulverizer to find
      sk + tn = 1
      sk + tn = 1 (mod n)
      sk + t0 = 1 (mod n)
      sk = 1 (mod n)
      So s is an inverse of k
    Can also cancel if relatively prime to n
      If a * k === b * k (mod n)
        and gcd(k, n) = 1 then
        multiply by k'
        (a * k)k' = (b * k)k' (mod n)
        a * 1 = b * 1
        a === b (mod n)
    Summary
      k is cancellable (mod n) iff
      k has an inverse (mod n) iff
      gcd(k, n) = 1 (k is relatively prime to n)
  Problem
    Inverse (mod 25) of 32
    s32 + t25 = 1
    Found answer 18 through brute force
    But how do I reverse to derive from pulverizer?
    Not sure from notes, wish I could ask more in section...
