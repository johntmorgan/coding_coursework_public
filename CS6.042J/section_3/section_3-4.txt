  The Division Rule
    Counting by ears and dividing by 2 is silly
    But illustrates powerful counting principle
    "k-to-1 function" maps exactly k elements of the domain to every element of codomain
    Function mapping ear to owner is 2-to-1
    Finger to owner is 10-to-1
    Division Rule
      If f : A -> B is k-to-1, then |A| = k * |B|
    Example
      Suppose A is set of ears in room and B is set of people
      2-to-1 mapping
      |A| = 2 * |B|
  Examples of when the division rule helps
    Chess Problem
      How many ways to place two rooks on a chessboard so do not share row/column
      Let A be set of all sequences where r1 and r2 are distinct rows
        And c1 and c2 are distinct columns
      Let B be the set of all valid rook configurations
      Natural function f from set A to set B
      But there's a snag: swapping rook positions is the same configuration!
      More generally f maps exactly two sequences to every board config
      f is a 2-to-1 function
      |B| = |A| / 2 = (8 * 7)^2 / 2
    Knights of the Round Table
      How many ways to arrange n different knights at round table
      Seatings are same arrangement if each sits between same two knights
      So seatings correspond to permutations of knights, and therefore n! of them
      However exact same order but rotated ("cyclically shifted") = same
        There are n ways to do this
      # seatings = n! / n = (n - 1)!
  Counting Subsets
    How many k-element subsets of an n-element set are there?
    Select 5 books from collection of 100
    13 card bridge hands from 52 card deck
    5 pizza toppings out of 14 available
    "n choose k" ::= the number of k-elements of n element subset
    Map any permutation of an n-element set into a k-element subset
      But taking the first k elements of the permutation
      Any other permutation with same first k-elements in any order
      And the same remaining n - k elements in any order
      Will also map to this set
      There are k! possible permutations of the first k elements
      There are (n - k)! possible permutations of the remaining elements
      k! * (n - k)! permuations of the n-element set map to specific subset
      Mapping from permutations to k-element subsets is k!(n - k)!-to-1
      We know n! permutations of n-element set so by division rule
      n! = k! * (n - k)! * n choose k
      n choose k = n! / (k! * (n - k)!)
      notice this works even for 0-element subsets - n! / (0! * n!) = 1
  Bit sequences
    How many n-bit sequences contain exactly k ones
      10011000
    Bijection to a k-element subset selection
      Number of n-bit sequences with exactly k ones is n choose k
    Number of ways to select n donuts when k flavors available
      n + (k - 1) choose n
  Sequences with Repetitions
    Sequences of Subsets
    Choosing k-element subset of n-element set is same as splitting into pair of subsets
    Let A be an n-element set and k1, k2, ... , km be nonneg ints with sum n
    The (k1, k2, ... km)-split of A
    Is a sequence (A1, A2,..., Am)
    Where the Ai are disjoint subsets of A and |Ai| = ki for i = 1,...,m
    To count splits take the same approach as for Subset Rule
    Map is a k1!k2! ... km!-to-1 function from the n! permutations to the (k1, k2,... ,km)-splits of A
    So from the Division Rule we conclude Subset Split Rule
    For n, k1,...,km in N, such that k1 + k2 + ... + km = n
    Define the multinomial coeff
    (n choose k1, k2, ..., km) ::= n!/k1!k2!...km!
  The Bookkeeper rule
    Can also generalize count of n-bit sequences with k ones to counting sequences of n letters
      Over an alphabet with more than 2 letters
    How many sequences can be formed by permuting BOOKKEEPER?
    1 B, 2 O, 2 K, 3 E, 1 P, 1 R
    bijection between permutations and (1,2,2,3,1,1) splits of {1,2,...,10}
    Namely map a permutation to the sequence of sets of positions where different letters appear
    So in the word itself
    ({1}, {2,3}, {4,5}, {6,7,9}, {8}, {10})
    From this bijection and subset split rule, we conclude it's
    10! / (1! * 2! * 2! * 3! * 1! * 1!)
    The (generalized) rule:
      let l1...lm be distinct elements. The number of sequences with k1 occurrences of l1,
      k2 occurrences of l2 ..., and km occurrences of lm is
      (k1 + k2 + ... + km) choose (k1,...,km)
    Suppose you plan a 20-mile walk
      Should include 5 N miles, 5 E, 5 S, 5 W
      How many different walks are possible?
      Bijection between such walks and sequences with 5N, 5E, 5S, 5W
      By bookkeeper rule, it's 20! / ((5!)^4)
  Note that subset split and bookkeeper rule are made-names
    Bookkeeper sometimes called "formula for permutations with indistinguishable objects"
  The binomial theorem
    A binomial is a sum of two terms, say a + b
      Now consider 4th power, (a + b)^4
      By using distibutivity of products to multiply we get
      = aaaa + aaab + ... + bbbb
      One term for every sequence of a's and b's. 2^4 terms
      Number of terms with k copies of b and n - k copies of a
      n choose k
      Therefore coefficient of a^(n-k)b^k is n choose k
      So for n = 4
      (a + b)^4 = 4 ch 0 * a^4 * b^0 + 4 ch 1 a^3 * b^1 ... (4 ch 4) a^0 * b^4
    Thm
      For all n in N and a, b in R
      (a + b)^n = sum k = 0 to n of n choose k * a^(n - k)b^k
    This is why n choose k is called a binomial coefficient
    Extends to multinomials
      Supposed wanted coeff of bo^2k^2e^3pr
      In the expansion of (b + o + k + e + p + r)^10
      Each term in this expansion is the product of 10 vars where each is one of b, o, k, e, p , or r
      Number of such terms is precisely the number of rearrangements of BOOKKEEPER
      10! / (1! * 2! * 2! * 3! * 1! * 1!)
    Multinomial Theorem
      For all n in N
      (z1 + z2 + ... + zm)^n = sum k1 + ... + km = n k1,...,km in N (n choose k1, k2, k3)z1^k1 * z2^k2 * ... zm^km
      But you're better off remembering the reasoning than the formal statement
  Poker Hand Practice
    Five-Card Draw: 5-card hand from 52 cards
    52 choose 5 = 2598960
    Let's work out the number of hands with various properties
    Four of a Kind
      Sequence specifies rank of 4 cards, rank of extra card, suit of extra card
      {8, Q, Heart} = four eights, queen, heart
      13 ways to choose first rank
      12 ways to choose second rank
      4 ways to choose scond suit
      13 * 12 * 4 = 624 hands, only about 1 in 4165
    Full house
      Rank of triple, 13 options
      Suits of triple, 4 choose 3
      Rank of pair, 12 options
      Suits of pair, 4 choose 2
      13 * 4 choose 3 * 12 * 4 choose 2
      Cool beans
    Two pair - speed bump - wrong answer first
      Rank of pair, 13 options
      Suits of pair, 4 choose 2
      Second pair, 12 options
      Suits of second pair, 4 choose 2
      Extra card - 11 ways
      Suit of extra card, 4 choose 1
      Wrong!
    Two pair
      Not a bijection from such sequences to hands with two pairs
      Actually a 2 to 1 mapping
      pair queens & pair 3s = pair 3s & pair queens
      Apply division rule, divide whole thing above by 2
    Avoiding mistakes
      When mapping f : A -> B
        Check that the same number of elements in A are mapped to each element in B
        if k elements of A map to each element of B, then apply the division rule
      Try solving the same problem in a second way
    Two pair, another solve
      Bijection between hands with two pairs and sequences that specify
      Ranks of the two pairs, can be chosen 13 choose 2 ways
      Suits of lower rank, can be chose 4 choose 2 ways
      Suits of higher rank, can be chosen 4 choose 2 ways
      Extra card rank can be chosen 11 ways
      Extra card suit can be chosen 4 choose 1 ways
      And multiply it out - same answer as before, different form
    Hands with every suit
      Ranks of each suit, can be selected 13^4 ways
      Suit of extra card - 4 ways
      Rank of extra card - 12 ways
      But there is actually a 2 to 1 mapping
        Extra card can double with one in the hand
      Number of hands with every suit
        13^4 * 4 * 12 / 2

Generalized Counting Rules
  Generalized product rule
  # lineups of 5 students in class
  Let S ::= students
  Say |S| = 91 so
  Basic product rule
    |lineups of 5 students| = 91^5 - NO! Same student can't appear twice
    |seqs in S^5 with no repeats| = 91 * 90 * 89 * 88 * 87
      = 91!/86!
  Q a set of length-k sequences
    if n1 possible first elements
    n2 possible second elements (for first entry)
    n3 possible third elements (for first and second entry) etc
    then |Q| = n1 * n2 * nk
  Division
    #6.042 students = #6.042 students' fingers / 10
      Of course that's a harder way to do it, not practical
      But illustrates basic straightforward idea
    If total function domain A to codomain B and mapping is k to 1
    Then |A| = k|B|
      Exactly k arrows into every element of B
      Generalized bijection rule
    Counting subsets
      How many size 4 subsets of {1,2, ..., 13}?
      Find a mapping from something you know how to count
      Let A ::= permutations of {1, 2, ..., 13}
      B ::= size 4 subsets
      map a1 a2 a3 a4 a5...a12 a13 in A
      to {a1, a2, a3, a4} in B
      Any perm with first 4 elements, but in same order, maps to the same
        a1 a3 a2 a4
      And whatever the remaining 9 elements also doesn't matter
      4! ways to permute the first four elements
      9! ways to permute the last nine elements
      (4! * 9!)-to-1 mapping
      13! = |A| = (4! * 9!)|B|
      So the number of size 4 subsets is
      13 choose 4 - "binomial coefficient notation"
      13! / (4! * 9!)
      m element subsets of an n element set is
      n choose m
      n! / (m! * (n - m)!)
  Counting in Poker
    Practice with these rules
    2 Pair in Poker
      5 card draw - dealt 5 cards from a deck of 52
      2 cards of some rank out of 13
      2 cards of a second rank
      1 card of a third rank
      To count, choose
        1st pair rank (13 ranks)
        2nd pair rank (12 ranks left)
        last card rank (11 ranks left)
      Then choose
        1st pair suits - 4 choose 2
        2nd pair suits - 4 choose 2
        last card suits - 4 choose 1 (4 suits)
      Specify hand
        K, A, 3, {diamond, heart}, {diamond, spade}, club
      So number of 2-pair hands is
        13 * 12 * 11 * 4 ch 2 * 4 ch 2 * 4
        NOPE! There is a bug
      This answer is set 1st card ranks x 2nd card ranks x last card rank x
        1st card suits x 2nd card suits x last card suit
      However it is not a bijection to all 2-pair hands
      Because
        A, K, 3, {diamond, spade}, {diamond, heart}, club is the same hand
      Mistake to distinguish first and second pair
        There are simply 2 pairs
        This is actually a 2-to-1 mapping
        So to fix
        13 * 12 * 11 * 4 ch 2 * 4 ch 2 * 4 / 2

    Product of sums = sums of products
    (1 + X)^n = c0 + c1X + c2X^2 + ... + CnX^n
    What is the expression for ck?
      (1 + X)^4 = 1 + 4X + 6X^2 + 4X^3 + 1X^4
      What is the pattern of coefficients?
      Write it out
        (1 + X)(1 + X)(1 + X)(1 + X)
        Apply distributive law
        Multiplying gives 2^n product terms
          11... 1 + X11X .... + XX...XX (middle term is just an example, not next in alpha answer)
          Correspond to every possible way to select terms
        X^k coefficient Ck is # terms with exactly k X's selected
          and n - k ones
        Ck = (n choose k)
    The Binomial formula
      (1 + X)^n =
      n ch 0 + (n ch 1) x + (n ch 2) x^2 + ... (n ch k)X^k + ... + (n ch n) X^n
    More general binomial formula
      (X + Y)^n =
      (n ch 0)Y^n + (n ch 1)XY^(n - 1) + (n ch 2)X^2 * Y^(n - 2) + ... +  (n ch k)X^k * Y^(n-k) + ... + (n ch n) X^n
    So
      (X + Y)^n = sum k=0 to n of (n ch k)X^k * Y^(n - k)
  Multinomial formula & bookkeeper rule

    10! ways to permute these letters with subscripts
    map word to letters without subscripts
      mapping is k-to-1
      but what is k?
        subscripts on os don't matter, 2 possible orders
        k's don't matter, 3 possible orders
      So mapping is 2! * 2! * 3! to one -> 10! (2! * 3! * 3!)
