  The Pigeonhole principle
    A drawer in a dark room contains red, green, and blue socks
    How many must you withdraw to get a matching pair?
      Picking 3 socks is not enough - can get 1 R, 1 B, 1 G
    If there are more pigeons than the holes they occupy, 2 must be in the same hole
    As soon as you pick 4 socks, there must be a pair
  Rigorous Pigeonhold
    If |A| > |B|, then for every total function f : A -> B, there exist two different elements of A
    that are mapped to the same element of B
    Contrapositive of Mapping Rule injective case
    Pigeons are set A
    Pigeonholes are set B
  Many ingenious applications for Pigeonhole Principle
    However no set rules for using it
    But in general try to identify the pigeon and pigeonhole sets
      Along with the function f for assigning pigeons to holes
  Generalized Pigeonhole
    If |A| > k * |B|, then every total function f : A -> B maps at least k + 1 different elements
    of A to the same element of B
    However, in the city of Boston, there is a group of 3 peoole with exactly same number of hairs!
    500k non-bald people in Boston
    200k hairs on a head
    |A| > 2|B|
      Of course we don't know who, but they exist
  Subsets with the same sum
    Ninety 25-digit numbers
      Are there two subsets that have the same sum?
      May seem silly but these sorts of problems key in many areas
        From fitting packages into shipping containers
        To decoding secret messages
      Hard to find the subset, easy to prove it exists
      Sum of any subset is at most 90 * 10^25
      We proved that an n-element set has 2^n different subsets
      |A| = 2^90 > 1.237 * 10^27
      On the other hand
      |B| = 90 * 10^25 + 1 <= 0.9-1 x 10^27
      Both quantities are enormous
        However |A| is a bit greater than |B|
        f maps at least two elements of A to the same element of B
      Notice this proof gives no indication which two sets have the same sum

        CS major, searched among a reasonably small set of "plausible" sets
          Sorted by sums
        Math major - reformulate as a "lattice basis reduction"
          Quickly found lots of pairs
      $500 prize for sets with dintct subset sums
        Construct a set of n positive integers such that all subsets distinct?
          Powers of two: {1, 2, 4, 8, 16}
          That approach seems so natural, suspect all sets must involve larger numbers
          Suprise, smaller examples are possible:
            {6, 9, 11, 12, 13}
        Paul Erdos conjectured no such sets involving significantly smaller
          The largest number in such a set must be greater than c2^n for c > 0
          $500 to prove or disprove conjecture, problem unsolved
    Magic trick
      Send assistant into the audience with 52 cards
      5 audience members select a card from the deck
      Assistant gathers and shows 4 to magician
      Magician names secret 5th card
      You'd expect some body language signal - but not needed
        Could choose 4! = 24 permutations of order of 4 shown cards - not enough
      Choose which of 5 cards to keep hidden
        Left hand vertices with 52 choose 5 elements
        Right hand vertices will have 52 * 51 * 50 * 49 elements
        Just need a matching
      Left vertex has degreee 5 * 4! = 120
        5 ways to select card kept secret
        4! permutations of the remaining cards
      Right vertex has degree 48
        48 possibilities for the 4th card
      Would work with up to 120 cards in the deck!
      But how does magician remember matching with 52 ch 5 edges?
      Pick 2 cards with paired suits
        Communicate number of hops clockwise from first card in suit shown
        SML - 1
        SLM = 2
        MSL = 3
        MLS = 4
        LSM = 5
        LMS = 6
      There is even a way to do it easily with up to 124 cards
        But still too involved to get into here
    Magic trick with 4 cards? No!
      |X| = 52 choose 4 = 270725
      |Y| = 52 * 51 * 50 = 132600
      Assistant must reveal same cards for ceil(270725/132600) = 3 different sets of 4 hands

Lecture
  Pigeonhole principle - counting principle so obvious you may be using it already without realizing
  Simple form:
    If more pigeons than pigeonholes, must have two pigeons in the same hole
  Mapping rule
    Total injection from A to B implies |A| <= |B|
    If |A| > |B|, then there is no total injection from A to B
  No elaborate uses of it here (like the hair example, or same sum example)
  Example: 5 card draw
    Must have two cards of the same suit in a hand
  10 card draw - how many have the same suit?
    Must have at least 3 with same suit
    ceil(10 / 4) = 3
  Generalized pigeonhole principle
    If n pigeons and h holes, then some hole has >= ceil(n / h) pigeons
  Inclusion-Exclusion
    The final general counting rule for us to examine
    Straightforward generalization of the sum rule, at least in the case of two sets
    Sum Rule
      |A U B| = |A| + |B| for disjoint sets A, B
    But what if A and B are not disjoint?
      |A U B| = |A| + |B| - |A int B|
      Not hard to make the argument for that
      When you add A, you count elements in intersection once
      Then when you add B, you count them again
        So subtract the size of A intersecting B
    Applied example
      Digit permutations of [0, 9]
      0123456789
      0134256789
      |permutations of [0,9]| = 10!
      How many permutations have "60", "04", or "42"?
        0123456789 - no
        0134256789 - yes - in P42
        0624136789 - no
        1304256789 - yes - in P04 int P 42
      Px ::= perms with subsequence x
      |P60 U P04 U P42| = ? these are not disjoint
      Need inclusion-exclusion for 3 sets not just 2
      Subtract 2x overlaps, but triple overlap subtracted 3 times
      |A U B U C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A int B| - |A int C| - |B int C| + |A int B int C|
      Will rigorously prove for arbitrary number of sets in a minute
      Intersections of even # sets occur negatively
      Intersections of odd # sets occur positively (including 1)
      |P60 U P04 U P42| = |P60| + |P04| + |P42| - |P60 int P04| - |P60 int P42| - |P04 int P42| + |P60 int P04 int P42|
      |P60| = |perms 1, 2, 3, 5, 60, 7, 8, 9|
            = There are 9 possible permutations of these things
            = 9! permutations
      |P60 int P42| = |perms {1, 3, 42, 5, 60, 7, 8, 9}|
            = 8! permutations
      |P60 int P04| = |P604| = 8!
      |P60 int P04 int P42| = |P6042| = 7!
      So |P60 U P04 U P42| = 3 * 9! - 3 * 8! + 7!
                           = 193 * 7! = 972720
                           ~27% of the 10! permutations possible
  Inclusion-Exclusion 2 set proof
    Ordinary disjoint sum rule
    Just break up |A U B| into disjoint sets
    A U B = A U (B - A) - A and points in B not in A - by sum rule
          = |A| + |B - A|
    Lemma
      |B - A| = |B| - |A int B|
      B = (B int A) U (B - A) disjoint union, sum rule
      |B| = |B int A| + |B - A|
      Proven Lemma, we're done
  For 3 sets, again:
    |A U B U C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A int B| - |A int C| - |B int C| + |A int B int C|
  Incl-Excl (n sets):
    |A1 U A2 U ... U An| = 
    Sum over every possible subets of indices 1-n that is not empty:
      |int Ai for i in S| - sum up intersection of Ais in S
      TIMES -1^(|S| + 1) - so add if odd (incl 1) and subtract if even
  Proof
    By induction on n - use 2 set version, already proved and go plus nth sets - not very informative
    By binomial counting
    By distributivity
