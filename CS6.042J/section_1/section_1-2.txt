Proof by cases
  Break into cases, prove each separately
  People have met or not
    If every pair has met: club
    If every pair has not met: strangers
  Theorem:
    Every collection of 6 people includes a club of 3 or group of 3 strangers
    Let x denote one of the six people
      Either at least 3/5 others have met or 3/5 have not
    Suppose 3/5 did meet
      None of those 3 have met? All stranger
      At least one pair has met? Club with x
    Suppose 3/5 did not meet
      Every pair met - they are a club
      Some pair did not meet - Stranger collection with x

Proof by contradiction
  Always viable, but slightly convoluted
  If false, then some false fact true
  Let's prove sqrt(2) is irrational
  Suppose claim is false, and sqrt(2) is rational
    Then sqrt2 = n/d fraction
             2 = n^2 / d^2
             2d^2 = n^2
             Implies n is a multiple of 2
             Therefore n^2 is a multiple of 4
             But since 2d^2 = n^2
             We know 2d^2 is a multiple of 4
             So d^2 is a multiple of 2
             n and d have 2 as a common factor
             n/d is not in lowest terms
             sqrt(2) must be irrational

Good proofs in practice
  Notion of proof is a moving target
  Proofs in pro research are unintelligible to all but a few experts
    Who know all terminology and prior results
  Proofs in this class "tediously long-winded" to pro mathematician
    What constitutes a good proof later in course will even change
  Write an essay with equations here and there
    Not just lots of equations in a row
    Avoid excessive symbolism
  Be wary of "obvious"

  Proof by contradiction
    May be so intuitive you don't even realize you've use it
    Is cubert(1332) <= 11
    Let's suppose this is true
    Cube both sides
      1332 <= 11^3
      1332 <= 1331 ?
      Not true
      So original assumption is not true
      cubrt(1332) > 11
      Without ever calculating cube root
    If assertion implies something false
      Assertion itself must be false
  Theorem
    sqrt(2) is irrational
    Suppose it's rational
    n and d without common prime factors
    Such that sqrt(2) = n / d
    Show n and d are both even, common factor 2
    dsqrt(2) = n
    2d^2  = n^2
    Left side is divisible by 2
      n must be even
    n = 2k (we don't care what k is)
    n^2 = 4k^2
    2d^2 = 4k^2
    d^2 = 2k^2
      d must be even
      QED
  Proof assumes if n^2 is even, n is even
  Why is this true
    Let's assume product of 2 odd numbers is odd
    Numbers factor into primes in an unique way
    If there's a 2 among the primes that divise n^2
    Powerful fact - prime factorizaton of integers

    Break it up into pieces that are easy to prove
    Java logical expressions
    Conditional guard on a bunch of code
    x & y floating point real numbers (or integers)
    if ((x > 0) || (x <= 0 && y > 10))
    Same thing as:
    if (x > 0 || y > 100)
    How to prove:
      If x is positive
        Whole top expression is true
        Whole bottom expression is true
      If x <= 0
        Ignore the first part entirely
        Top case
          x <= 0 && y > 100
          But we already know x <= 0
          So depends entirely on &&
          So y > 100
    Break complicated subproblems into easier subproblems
      Chose different x cases
