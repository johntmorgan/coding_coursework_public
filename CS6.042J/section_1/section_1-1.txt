Summary
  Fundamental concepts of discrete mathematics
    Sets, relations, proof methods
    Math CS folks need regularly and NOT in regular calculus classes
      (Which I barely remember now, eep - JM)
    In calculus
      Functions on real and complex numbers
    In CS
      Much more abstract data types
      Even functions on functions
    Talk about standard discrete structures
      Starting with numbers
        Which we think of as a structure
        The numbers with operations packaged on them
      Graphs
      Trees
      Methods for counting the numbers of these data structures
        How big is the search space
          If you're hashing a password, it better be large or it's getting cracked quickly
    Discrete probability theory
      A version of probability theory
      Where we get by with sums, not complications of integrals
    What does discrete mean?
      Study of "discrete" structures
        Integers, graphs, logical statements
      Vs. continuous
        Real numbers, calculus, Euclidean geometry
      Discrete objects can often be enumerated by integers
        More formally - branch of math dealing with countable sets
        Finite sets, sets with same cardinality as the natural numbers
        However there is no exact definiton of the term
          (So thanks for telling me to look it up, lol - JM)

  What is a proof?
  A proposition
    A statement that is either true or false
  Not always easy to check
    Is n^2 + n + 41 prime for all non-negative integers?
    Works all the way up to n = 39
    But p(40) = 41 * 41 which is not prime
    In fact NO polynomial with integer coefficients can map all non-negative into prime numbers
      (Unless it's a constant)
  You can't check a claima about an infinite set
    By checking a finite set of its elements
      No matter how large the set!
  Upside-down A
    "for all"
    n
    EE in
    N non-negative integers
  Euler's conjecture
    a^4 + b^4 + c^4 = d^4 always false?
      Disproven by Noam Elkies with some big numbers
    Z+ positive integers
  313(x^3 + y^3) = z^3
    has no solution when xyz EE Z+
    False, but smallest counterexample has 1k+ digits!
  Four color theorem
    Every map can be colored with four colors such that adjacent regions have different colors
    True
    But laboriously proved, need special checking of hundreds of maps
      First by hand in the 70s, then later by computer
  Fermat's last theorem
    There are no positive integers such that
    x^2 + y^2 = z^2 for some integer n > 2
    Proved to hold for up to 4m
      But that should not inspire confidence given the 313 example above
    Proven in 1994 by Andrew Wiles after 7 years of isolated work (oh boy)
  Goldbach's conjecture
    Every even integer > 2 is sum of 2 primes
    Has been around since 1742
    Known to hold for all numbers up to 10^18
    Truth still unknown

  Anyway, for CS folks
    Important to prove correctness of programs and systems
    Programs are notoriously buggy
    CPU chips are now proven correct
      Notorious Intel division bug of the 1990s
    We'll illustrate how to do that in chapter 5

  Predicate
    A proposition whose truth depends on value of 1+ variables
    "N is a perfect square"
      But what is the value of n?
    P is predicate
    P(n) ::== "n is a perfect square"
    but if p(n) = n^2 + 1 then p(n) is a numerical quantity

  The axiomatic method
    Euclid, Egypt 300 BC
    Start with 5 assumptions about geometry
      Seem undeniable
      "There is a straight line segment between every pair of points"
    Propositions accepted as true = "axioms"
    Starting from axioms, establish many more propositions with proofs
    Important true propositions = theorem
    Lemma = preliminary proposition useful for proving later propositions
    Corollary = proposition that follows in a few steps from a theorem
    These definitions are not precise!
      Sometimes a lemma turns out to be more important than the main theorem!
    Axioms today?
      Zermelo-Frankel with Choice axioms
      + a few logical deduction rules
      Sufficient to derive basically all of mathematics (Chapter 7)

  Our axioms
    ZFC important to study and justify foundations of mathematics
      However too primitive for practical purposes
      Kind of like writing programs in byte code instead of a real language
      2 + 2 = 4... 20k steps
        (What the heck - JM)
    So instead we take a huge set of axioms: all of basic high school math
      Can be a little fuzzy
      Just be up front about what you assume

  Logical deductions "inference rules"
    Used to prove new propositions from previously proved ones

  Modus ponens
    Prove P
    Prove P implies Q
    You have proved Q

    P, P implies Q
    ---------------
          Q

    "Antecedents" above line
    "Conclusion" or "consequent" below line
    Must be "sound"
      Assignment of truth values to P, Q
      That makes all antecedents true
      Also makes consequent true

    P implies Q, Q implies R
    -> P implies R

    Not(P) implies Not(Q)
    -> Q implies P

    BUT
    Not(P) implies Not(Q)
    -> P implies Q
      NOT sound
      P is true, Q is false
      Antecedent true
      Consequent not
  How do you even start a proof?
    Many follow a handful of standard templates

  1. Prove an implication
    If P, then Q (P implies Q)
    "Assume P"
    Show that Q logically follows

  Theorem
    If 0 <= x <= 2, then -x^3 + 4x + 1 > 0
    Can see why - 4x > x^3 until x > 2
    Factor this
      -x^3 + 4x = x(2 - x)(2 + x)
      Ah, everything on right side is non-negative
      As long as 0 <= x <= 2

    Assume 0 <= x <= 2
    Then x, 2 - x, and 2 + x are all non-negative
    Therefore product of terms is also non-negative
    Adding 1 gives a positive number so
    x(2 - x)(2 + x) + 1 > 0
    Muliplying the left side proves that
    -x^3 + 4x + 1 > 0

  Often need to do some scratchwork while figuring out a proof
    Keep it separate! Keep proof concise!
  Start with "Proof"
  End with "QED" or a square
    Just conventions like writing begin/rescue in rails

  Prove contrapositive
    Not Q implies Not P is as good as P implies Q

  We prove the contrapositive:
  Theorem:
    If r is irrational, than sqrt(r) is also irrational
    Rational when it equals a quotient of integers
      m/n for some integers m and n
    So if r is not a ratio of integers, sqrt(r) also not a ratio
    Contrapositive:
      If sqrt(r) is a ratio, r is also a ratio

    Assume sqrt(r) is rational
      So there exist integers m and n where sqrt(r) = m/n
      Square both sides:
        r = m^2 / n^2
        Since m^2 and n^2 are integers, r is also rational

  Prove if and only if
    Two triangles have the same side lengths if and only if two side lengths and angle are same
    "iff"
    P iff Q ->
      P implies Q
      Q implies P
    - Show both directions
    - Chain of iffs

  Proofs
  How to do proofs and not be afraid of them
  Distinguish very plausible argument from totally right
  Physicists do a lot of math
    Don't worry about proofs much
  Theorists & mathematicians
    Need to know how to prove basic facts
  Pragmatically
    Lots of content in this subject
    And if the only way to figure out details is memorization, get lost
  Let's look at examples of proofs
  Pythagorean theorem
    a^2 + b^2 = c^2
    Very familiar? Yes
    Obvious? No
      People keep proving it over millenia
  A cool proof of pythagorean theorem
    4 copies of ABC triangle
    And a square of unknown size
    Rearrange shapes to form a C x C square
    Rearrange fo form a x a and b x b
    Square is b-a based on cxc square
    And then in different config square + a x a + b x b
  What about this proof?
    Elegant and correct
    Proof by picture
    But worrisome in general
      Lots of hidden assumptions
        Right angles
          Triangle angles sum to 180 degrees
        Things are rectangles
        Straight lines along side
  Bogus proof - by picture
    Getting rich by diagram
      Imagine 10x11 rectangular gold foil
      Mark off the corners
        Mark off length of one
        Expand out beyond square
        Now have 11 x 10
        Remove triangles!
        Rotate 90 degrees and repeat!
      But triangles are not right triangles
        Lying against diagonal not 90 degres
        So top and bottom of rectangle are not straight
        But 10 and 11 are close enough it's not visually obvious
  Another bogus proof - by calculation
    Every polynomial
      ax^2 + bx + c
      has two roots over C (complex numbers)
    r1 ::= (-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2
    r2 ::= (-b - sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2
    Plug these formulas in and ax^2 + bx + c simplifies to 0
    So every polynomial has two roots! No.
    Counter-examples:
      0x^2 + 0x + 1 has 0 roots = never crosses origin
             1x + 1 has 1 root - 45 degree, y = x line, crosses origin once
    Bug: divide by 0 error
      Quotient of a in quadratic formula
      So you much require a != 0
    But then:
      1x^2 + 0x + 0 has 1 root (just 0)
      Bug: r1 = r2
      Fix: require  D != 0
      where D ::= b^2 - 4ac
    But what if D < 0?
      x^2 + 1 has roots i, -i
        Both behave the same way
        Ambiguous which is r1 and r2
        Can cause problems
        1 = sqrt(1) = sqrt(-1 * -1) = sqrt(-1)*sqrt(-1) = -1
    Moral
      Be sure rules are properly applied
      Thoughtless calculation is risky when you don't understand it
        Hence why I'm doing this - JM
    Consequences of 1 = -1
      1/2 = -1/2
      2 = 1
