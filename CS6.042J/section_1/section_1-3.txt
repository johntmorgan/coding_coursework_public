Well ordering principle
  Every nonempty set of non-negative integers has a smallest element
  Very important proof rule
    Took for granted in proving sqrt(2) rational
    Assumed for any positive integers m and n
    m/n can be written in lowest terms
    That is m'/n' where m' and n' positive integers with no common prime factors
    How do we know possible?
  Suppose to contrary
    m/n cannot be written in lowest terms
    C positive integers that are numerators
    Then m EE C so C is non-empty
    There must be a smallest integer m0 EE C
    There is an integer n0 > 0 such that m0/n0 cannot be written in lowest terms
    So m0 and n0 must have a common prime factor, p > 1.
    But (m0 / p) / (n0 / p) = m0 / n0
    So (m0 / p) / (n0 / p) cannot be written in lowest terms either
    So m0/p is in C
    But m0/p is in C, contradicting m0 being smallest in C
    So C must be empty
    So no numerators that can't be written in lowest terms
    Therefore no such fractions at all
  Well ordering template
    P(n) - proposition
    N - non-negative integer
    Prove that P(n) is true for all n EE N using well ordering
    C ::= n EE N NOT(P(n)) is true
    Assume for proof by contradiction that C is non-empty
      I.e. assume there is a non-negative integer where NOT P(n) true
    There will be a smallest element n0 in C
      Reach a contradiction somehow
        Show that P(n0) is actually true
        Show another member of C is smaller than n
    Conclude that C must be empty
    That is, no counterexamples exist
  Let's prove:
    1 + 2 + 3... + n = n(n + 1) / 2
    First address ambiguous special cases
    If n = 1... only term so sum is just "1"
    If n = 0... no terms, by convention sum is 0
    Always be careful when you see ellipses!
    Sum(i = 1; n) i
    OR
    Sum(1 <= i <= n) i
    Sum of no numbers = 0 by convention
    Makes it clear how to handle n = 1
  Anyway, assume
    Sum(i = 1; n) i = n(n + 1) / 2 is false
    Some non-negative integers must serve as a counter example
    Let's collect them in a set C
    C must have a minimum element c
    1 + 2 + 3... + n = n(n + 1) / 2
      is False when n = c
      but also true for all n < c
      so it is true for c - 1 (here comes the induction - JM)
      1 + 2 + 3... c - 1 = (c - 1)c / 2
      BUT add c to both sides
      1 + 2 + 3... c - 1 + c = (c - 1)c / 2 + c = (c^2 - c + 2c) / 2 = c(c + 1) / 2
      Which means it holds for c after all
      Contradiction, we're done
  Factoring into primes
    Prime Factorization Theorem has been taken for granted
      Every integer greater than 1 has a unique expression as a product of prime numbers
    Let C be the set of all integers greater than 1 that cannot be factored as prime product
    C is not empty
    If C is not empty, there is a least element n by well ordering
    The n can't be prime because a prime b itself is a length one product of primes
    So n must be a product of two integers a and b where 1 < a, b < n
    a and b cannot be in C
    a is a product of primes
    b is a product of primes
    but therefore n is a product of the a and b subprimes
    Therefore n cannot be in C

Lecture
  Well ordering
    So obvious in math that you hardly notice it
  Every nonempty set of nonnegative integeres has a least element
  Familiar? Now you mention it, yes
  Obvious, yes
  Trivial? yes, but watch out!
    What if you replace integers with rationals?
      NO
    There's a least non-negative rational, 0
    But not every non-negative set of rationals has a least element
      If well-ordering, least positive p/q
      But you can always make it smaller by doing p/2q
    Is there a least negative integer?
      No! -1, -2, etc. it keeps going
  We take for granted well ordering
    What is the youngest age of a MIT graduate
      Would not wonder if that exists
    Smallest # of neurons in an animal
      Would not wonder if it exists
    Smallest # of coins = $1.17
  For rest of this talk
    Number means non-negative integer N with diagonal double bar
      "natural numbers" - is 0 natural or not though - so does NOT use this
  Sqrt(2) proof used well ordering
    Why every fraction can be expressed in lowest terms
    sqrt(2) = m / n
    m has got to be in lowest terms
    then (m0 / c) / (n0 / c) - contradicts way m0 was chosen in first place
  Let's look at 2 examples of using well ordering
  Prove every integer greater than 1 is a product of primes
    Proof by contradiction
    { nonproducts is non empty }
    Must be m > 1 that is a non product
    If m itself is a prime, by convention it fits (considered to be 1 * m)
      So we know m itself is NOT a prime
    So m must be a product of two numbers j, k > 1 and < m
    j, k < m
    So both are prime products
    Because they're smaller than m
    m = jk = j primes & k primes
    m is a prime product, a contradiction
    No counterexamples, QED
  More interesting example
    Reasoning about postage
    3c and 5c stamps (Fizzbuzz nums - JM)
    What postage can you make out of this?
    n is postal if can make (n + 8)c postage from 3c and 5c stamps
    Theorem: every number is postal
    Can make every amount of postage from 8c or more
    Apply WOP, suppose NOT
    Number that is not postal
    m is the least counterexample
    Any number k smaller than m is postal
    0 is postal -> 8 = 3 + 5
      so m != 0
    1 is postal -> 9 = 3 * 3
    2 -> 10 = 2 * 5
    m >= 3
    Now m - 3 is a number < m, so is postal
    But m - 3 + 3 = m so m is postal too
    Contradiction
    So every number is postal

  Part III
    Theorem application, one we care about
    1 + r + r^2 + r^3 + r^n = (r^(n+1) - 1) / (r - 1)
    Holds for all non-negative integers n
    And for all real numbers r that aren't 1
      Which would make the denominator 0
    Prove by WOP. Let m be smallest n where it doesn't work
    But equal for n = 0, so m is > 0
    So m must be positive
    And therefore m - 1 must make equality hold
    ... r^(m - 1) = (r^((m - 1) + 1) - 1) / r - 1
    ... r^(m - 1) = r^m - 1 / r - 1
          ... r^m = (r^m - 1) / r - 1 + r^m
                  = (r^m - 1 + r^(m+1) - r^m) / r - 1
                  = (r^(m + 1) - 1) / (r - 1)
    So equal at m, contradicting
      Holds for all values of n
    Let's organize
      For all n in N .P(n) using WOP
    Define set of counterexamples
    Assume C is not empty, must be minimum element m in C
    Reach a contradiction somehow
      This is where the template goes out the window
      But usually you want to find a number c in C less than m
      OR
      By proving P(m) actually works, not a counterexample
