Independence
Reading
  Suppose flip two fair coins on opposite sides of the room
  Intuitively, one coin landing does not affect the way the other lands
  Event with probability 0 is independent of everything including itself
  If Pr[B] != 0 though:
  Independent iff Pr[A | B] = Pr[A]
  Disjoint events are NOT independent!
    If A int B = 0, knowing A happens means you know B does not happen
    Disjoint events are NEVER independent, unless one has Pr = 0
  Independent def 2:
    A is independent of B iff Pr[A int B] = Pr[A] * Pr[B]
  Notice symmetry
    A is independent of B iff B is independent of A
  Independence is an assumption
    Pr two coins heads = 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4
    In this case, reasonable assumption
    But many cases where unjustified
      Hourly forecast 10% per hour, 90% dry
      Odds of dry day != (0.9)^12 = 0.28
      If it's dry at 5 PM, odds higher than 90% dry at 6 PM
    Deciding when to assume independence is tricky: examples ahead
  Mutual independence
    What if there are more than 2 events?
      Flips of n coins all independent of each other
    Probability of each event in set same no matter which of other events
    For any selection of 2+ events, probability all occur = product of individ probs.
  DNA testing
    OJ Simpson blood 1/170m odds
    Marker A - 1/100, marker B - 1/50, marker C = 1/40 etc.
    1/100 * 1/50 * 1/40 * 1/5 * 1/170
      Defense pointed out this assumes the markers appear independently
      Statistics based on just a few hundred blood samples
        Does this make sense?
  Pairwise independence
    3x coinflips
      Three events A1, A2, A3 are not mutually independent
      Even though any two are independent
    Set of events is k-way independent
      iff every set of k of those events is mutually independent
    Set is pairwise independent iff 2-way independent
      So 3x coinflips are pairwise independent, but not mutually independent
        Pairwise is much weaker than mutual
      Suppose the 5 markers in the OJ case were pairwise independent
        Then probability of having all markers not more than
          1/100 * 1/170 = 1/17000
        Of course if they are not independent at all
          Then you just have 1/170
    Assuming mutual independence may not be reasonable without
      Hundreds of millions of blood samples

Lecture
  Independent events have nothing to do with each other
  Easy to work with, don't have to figure out interaction
  Often come up with e.g. 5 coin tosses
    Any reason to think any influence on the 6th flip? No
  Technical definition
    Events A and B are independent iff
      Pr[A] = Pr[A | B]
  Another (less intuitive?) definition
    Pr[A] * Pr[B] = Pr[A int B]
  Need Pr[B] != 0 for definition 1
  While the second definiton always works
  Symmetric in A and B so
    A independent of B iff B independent of A
  Corollary:
    If Pr[B] = 0, then vacuously, B independent of everything including itself
  A indep of B means A is indep of whether B occurs
  Lemma
    A independent of B iff A independent of NOT(B)
    Simple proof using Pr[A - B] = Pr[A] - Pr[A int B]
  Mutual independence
    Events A1, A2, An are mutually independent
    When probability Ai occurrs is unchanged by which other ones occurs
    Pr[Ai] = Pr[Ai | Aj int Ak int ... int Am]
    Alternate
      Pr[Ai int Aj int ... int Am] = Pr[Ai] * Pr[Aj] * ... * Pr[Am]
    Example
      Successive coin flip
      H ::= ith flip is heads
      What happens on 5th flip is independent of 1st, 4th, 7th flip
      Pr[H5] = Pr[H5 | H1 int H4 int NOT(H7)] etc
  Pairwise independence
    Flip a fair coin twice
    H1 ::= [Head on 1st flip]
    H2 ::= [Head on 2nd flip]
    O ::= [Odd # heads]
    Claim: O is independent of H1
      May seem weird - O depends on both first and second flip
      Check with official definition
      O = {HT, TH}, Pr[O] = 1/2
      O int H1 = {HT} Pr[{HT}] = 1/4
      Pr[O int H1] = 1/4 = Pr[O] * Pr[H1]
    However O, H1, H2 NOT mutually independent
      If you know any 2, you can figure out third one
      Pr[O | H1 int H2] = 0 != Pr[O]
      Any two are independent, but the three of them are not independent
  K-way independence
    Flip a fair coin k times
    Hi ::= [Head on ith flip]
    O ::= [Odd # Heads]
    Any set of k of these events are mutually independent
    But all k + 1 of them are not
      In fact the first k will 100% determine the last
    Events A1, A2, ... are k-way independent
      If any k of them are mutually independent
    Pairwise is this for k = 2
    O, H1, ... Hk are k-way, not (k + 1)-way independent
    But you need to check all the equations
      2^n - (n + 1) equations to check!
        (minus n + 1 because don't need to check singletons, empty)
        Not easy to verify mutual independence via this calculation
        Usually arrive at it by assumption most of the time
