Events and Probability Spaces
Reading
  Example - Monty Hall - Marilyn Vos Savant
    Let's Make a Deal
    3 doors - 1 car, 2 goats
    Pick a door, host opens another door, it has a goat
    Should you switch doors?
      Marilyn: yes
      Letters: wrong!
    Intuition leads to the wrong conclusion here
    Follow a rigorous approach such as Four Step Method
    First let's make sure we understand the problem
      Car equally likely to be behind any door
      Player equally likely to pick each door
      Host must open a door with a goat from remaining 2
      Host equally likely to select if has a choice
  The Four Step Method
    Every probability problem involves some sort of randomized experiment/process/game
      How to model mathematically?
      How to solve the resulting problem?
    Step 1: find the sample sapce
      Set of all possible outcomes
      Tree diagram to work through if outcomes not too large
      12 possible outcomes for Monty hall
      Where is car, door chosen, door opened by host
      S = {(A, A, B), (A, A, C), (A, B, C), (A, C, B),
            B, B, A), (B, B, C), (B, C, A), (B, A, C),
            C, A, B), (C, B, A), (C, C, A), (C, C, B)}
    Step 2: define events of interest
      In half the outcomes the player wins by switching
        Might be tempted to conclude switching player wins with probability 1/3
          This is wrong
          Not all outcomes are equally likely
    Step 3: determine outcome probabilities
      3a assign edge probabilities
        Note that when host has no choice, probability 1
      3b compute outcome probabilities
        Mechanical process by multiplying edge-probabilities on path from root to outcome
        So Pr[(A, A, B)] = 1/18
        Pr[(A, A, C)] = 1/18
        Pr[(A, B, C)] = 1/9
    Step 4: compute event probabilities
      Pr[switching wins] = Pr[(A, B, C)] + Pr[(A, C, B)] + Pr[(B, C, A)] +
        Pr[(B, C, A)] + Pr[(C, A, B)] + Pr[(C, B, A)]
        = 1/9 * 6 = 2/3
      It seems Marilyn is correct! A player who switches wins with probability 2/3
      However the player who stays original wins probability 1/3
        Because staying wins only if switching loses
      Just needed to add fractions to get here
        Key was avoiding leap to "intuitively obvious" answer
  Monty Hall postscript
    Marilyn is right... but only if she interpreted Craig's letter right
      On the actual show, Monty could also open the door the contestant picked first
      In fact Monty could give the switch option only to contestants who picked right originally
        Then switching never works!
  Example 2: Strange Dice
    Three strange dice
    Each player selects and rolls once
    Winner gets $100
    The dice - opposte sides have the same number (Die A intuitively looks best to me - JM)
      1) 2 6 7
      2) 1 5 9
      3) 3 4 8
    Or what if you get $105 to $100 and get to pick first?
    Sample space S for die A & B
      S = {(2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 6), (6, 1), (6, 5), (6, 9), (7, 1), (7, 5), (7, 9)}
    Die A > die B on 5/9 rolls
      {(2, 1), (6, 1), (6, 5), (7, 1), (7, 5)}
    All edges have probability 1/9 - 1/3 for each die
      "Uniform sample space"
      Makes things very easy - just compute number of outcomes
      Event E = A beats B
      Pr[E] = |E|/|S| = 5/9
    A vs. C
      S = {(2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 8), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 8), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 8)}
      Event E = A beats C
      {(6, 3), (6, 4), (7, 3), (7, 4)}
      4/9 - so C > A
    B vs. C
      S = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 8), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 8), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 8)}
      Event E = B beats C
      S = {((5, 3), (5, 4), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 8)}
      5/9, so B > C
    So C > A 5/9, A > B 5/9, and B > C 5/9
    Seems like this ought to be transitive, but it's not
      Picking first is actually a disadvantage here!
    Ok, how about rolling a die twice?
      Tree diagram now has four levels, 81 possible outcomes
      But equally likely A sums of (4, 8, 8, 9, 9, 12, 13, 13, 14)
      B sums of (2, 6, 6, 10, 10, 10, 14, 14, 18)
      Counting pairs shows 37 pairs where A > B and 42 where B > A, 2 ties
    Surprising, right?
      Die A is favored on a single roll, but not on a double roll
      In fact die strength completely reverses on a double roll
      Single: A > B > C > A
      Double: A < B < C < A
      Generalizes in a remarkable way
      There are arbitrarily large sets of dice will beat each other in any desired pattern
        Depending on the number of dice rolls
  The Birthday Principle
    There are 95 students in a class. What is the probability two share a birthday?
      You might guess ~1/4 since 95/365
      But very wrong, probability > 0.9999
    Assume probability a randomly chosen student has a birthday is 1/d
      d = 365, n = 95
      Randomness not really true - periodicity in births, class selections linked (e.g. twins)
    d^n sequences of n birthdays
      These are equally likely
      There are (d)(d - 1)(d - 2)... (d - (n - 1)) length n sequens of distinct birthdays
      (d)(d - 1)(d - 2)... (d - (n - 1)) / d^n
      d / d * (d - 1) / d * (d - 2) / d ... d - (n - 1)) / d
      (1 - 0/d) * (1 - 1/d) * (1 - 2/d) ... (1 - (n - 1) / d)
      since 1 + x < e^x
      < e^0 + e^(-1/d) + e^(-2/d)... e^(-(n-1)/d)
      = sum i = 1 to n - 1 of i /d
      = e^(-n(n - 1) / 2d)
        For n = 95 and d = 365, value < 1/200000
      For d < n^2/2 probability of no match asymtotically equal to the upper bound
        For d = n^2/2, equal to 1/e
    Birthday principle
      If there are d days in a year and sqrt(2d) people in a room, probability that share bday
        Is about 1 - 1/e ~= 0.632
      So if sqrt(2 * 365) ~= 27 in a room, probability is ~0.632 (actual is 0.626)
    If you use a hash function that maps n items into hash table size d
      Expect many collisions if n^2 more than a small fraction of d
      Also basis of "birthday attack" cracking some crypto
  Set Theory and Probability
    Let's abstract into a general mathematical definition
    Probability spaces
      Countable sample space S is a nonempty countable set
      Element lomega in S is called an outcome
        A subset of S is called an event
      Probability function on a sample space S is a total function Pr: S -> R such that
      Pr[lomega] >= 0 for all lomega in S and
      sum lomega in S PR[lomega] = 1
      Sample space + probability function = probability space
      For any event E C= S
        Probability of E is defined to be sum of probabilities of outcomes in E
        Pr[E] ::= sum lomega in E Pr[lomega]
      So far only finite possible outcomes
      But soon, countably infinite number of outcomes
      Any set can be a sample space, any subset can be an event
        General probability theory deals with uncountable sets like real numbers
        But will stick to countable, using sums not integrals
        Avoid distracting technical issues in set theory like Banach-Tarski "paradox"
    Probability rules from set theory
      Most rules extend from finite sets very naturally
      For disjoint events E and F
        Pr[E U F] =  Pr[E] + Pr[F]
      Generalized to countable number of events - Sum rule
        PR[ big union n in N of En] = Sum of n in N of Pr[En]
      Lets us analysze a complicated event by breaking down into simpler cases
      Consequence:
        Pr[A] + NOT(Pr[A]) = 1
        Follows because Pr[S] = 1 and S is the union of disjoint A and NOT(A)
        Pr[NOT(A)] = 1 - Pr[A] - complement rule
      More rules
        Pr[B - A] = Pr[B] - Pr[A int B]
        Pr[A U B] = Pr[A] + Pr[B] - Pr[A int B]
        Pr[A U B] <= Pr[A] + Pr[B]
        If A C= B, then Pr[A] <= Pr[B]
      Union Bound
        Pr[E1 U ... U En U ...] <= Pr[E1] + ... + Pr[En] +...
        Useful in many calculations
        Suppose Ei is the chance the ith critical component in a spacecraft fails
        Then E1 U ... U En is the event that some critical component fails
          If sum i = 1 to n of Pr[Ei] is small, Union Bound upper bound of overall probability critical failure
      Uniform Probability Spaces
        Finite probability space S is uniform if Pr[lomega] same for every outcome lomega in S
        Saw in strange dice problem
        Uniform sample spaces particularly easy to work with
        That's because for any event E C= S
        Pr[E] = |E| / |S|
        Once we know cardinality of E and S, immediately obtain Pr[E]
        Great, have lots of tools for computing cardinality of a set
        Example
          Select 5 cards at random from a standard deck of 52 cards
          What is probability of having a full house?
          |S| = 52 ch 5
          |E| = 13 * (4 ch 3) * 12 * (4 ch 2)
          Where E is full house event
          Every five-card hand is equally likely
          Pr[E] = |E|/|S| = 13 * (4 ch 3) * 12 * (4 ch 2) / 52 ch 5
                          = 13 * 12 * 4 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 / 52 * 51 * 50 * 49 * 48
                          = 18 / 12495
                          ~= 1/694
      Infinite probability spaces
        Actually fairly common
        Example
          Two players take turns flipping a coin
          First to flip heads wins
          Pr[first player wins] = 1/2 + 1/8 + 1/32
                                = 1/2 sum n=0 to inf (1/4)^n
                                = 1/2 (1/(1 - 1/4)) = 2/3
          So Pr[second player wins] = 1/4 + 1/16 + 1/64 + 1/256 + ... = 1/3
        Sample space S is the infinite set
          S ::= {T^nH | n in N}
          Where T^n stands for a length n string of Ts
          Pr[T^nH] ::= 1 / (2^(n + 1))
        To verify that this is a probability space, check all probs nonneg, sum to 1
        sum n in N of Pr[T^nH] = sum n in N of 1/(2^(n + 1)) = 1
        Notice that model does not have an outcome where they flip tails forever
        Can add lomega(forever), with probability... zero
          So generally can ignore in countable probability spaces

Lecture
  More thorough and theoretical look at what you already learned in high school (probably!)
  Has been debate among faculty - up with chem, phys, math as a key thing every student should know
  Historically
    Starts off disreputable late 17th, early 18th centuries to analyze gambling
  Basis of insurance industry - underwriting, premiums
  Understanding error in sample, confirm hypotheses
  True to the historical basis, let's start with gambling
    Then working up to tree model
  Example from poker - probability of exactly 2 jacks in each hand
    Really a counting problem
    52 ch 5 possible 5-card hands
    4 ch 2 ways of picking Jack suits
    4 ch 2 * 52 - 4 ch 3 hands
    Pr{2 Jacks} = (4 ch 2 * 52 - 4 ch 3) / 52 ch 5 ~= 0.04
    Under this interpretation
    Probability says - what's fraction of time I get what I want/win
  Probability: 1st idea
    A set of basic experimental "outcomes"
    A subset of outcomes is an "event"
    Probability of an event
      Pr{event} ::= # outcomes in event / total number of outcomes
    First naive approach
      Applies to a lot of cases, but not always
  Here's the problem: Monty Hall
    Let's Make A Deal (1970's show, host name: Monty Hall) - still has a fanbase now
    Three doors on stage
      A prize behind one of them
      Beautiful woman holding goat behind others
      (Actual show had more rules, but for sake of simplicity)
    Assume staff on purpose place prize at random behind doors
      No cheating - prize stays there
    Contestant picks a door
    Monty reveals a goat behind an unpicked door
    Contestant sticks or switches to the other unopened door
    Marilyn Vos Savant explained Game in magazine "Ask Marilyn"
      Advertised herself as highest recorded IQ of all time
      Firestorm of response, even with math Ph.D.s
    Either sticking and switching are equally good
    Or switching is much better
  Analyzing Monty Hall
    Draw tree of possible steps to help
    3 possibilities for where prize is (symmetric)
    3 possibilities contestant picks
      1/3 picked right
        either of other two doors open
      1/3 picked wrong
        other goat revealed - switch to win
      1/3 picked wrong
        other goat revealed - switch to win
    Look at whole tree
      12 outcomes, 6 L and 6 W
      If switching wins, sticking loses
      Win by sticking iff lose by switching (doesn't hold if > 3 doors, that's another exercise)
    False conclusion
      Reason as if poker hands
        Same number of outcomes, so doesn't matter - probability same, 1/2
          Wrong!
      Think about what happens after first door opened
        Two closed doors left, with and without prize
        Contestant doesn't know what's behind door
        Equally likely doesn't matter stick/switch - also wrong!
    What is wrong? Let's go look at outcome tree
      Structure of tree leading to leaves is not the same
      Don't treat the branches the same way
      Let's put probability on branch
      1/3 for location
      1/3 for contestant picks
        Contestant picks right (1/3) - Carol picks 1/2 doors
        Contestant picks wrong (2/3) - Carol picks unchosen door - 100%
      All 6 good stick outcomes odds 1/18 -> 1/3
      All 6 good switch outcomes odds 1/9 -> 2/3
      Pr{switch wins} = 2/3
      So sticking is a bad strategy, switching way to go
      In class, back up with experiments - turns out to be true
  2nd key idea in probability
    Outcomes may have differing probabilities! Not always uniform
  Finding probability
    Intuition is important but dangerous, esp for beginners
    Stick with 4-part method:
      1. Identify outcomes (tree helps)
      2. Identify event (winning)
      3. Assign outcome probabilties (use tree and logic)
      4. Compute event probabilities (add up outcomes)
  The Monty Hall tree we used
    Very literal, overkill
    Next section - how to make simpler argument
  Simplified Monty Hall tree
    Prior tree was absurdly large and literal (didn't copy whole thing - JM)
    Could have just analyzed one branch
      And don't need the first branch
    Zoom in on that branch
      Instead of saying "prize is at door 2"
      Contestant picks prize, or misses at 1, or misses at 2
      Have captured whole story by relativizing the first move
        Will get some mileage out of whole tree later
      But if thinking solely about switch strategy, better way to start
      Also since talking about switching - collapse p = 1 branch
      If switching
        Pick a no-prize door and win
        Pick a prize door and lose
      Can collapse your no-prize door
        No-prize door = 2/3
        Prize door = 1/3
      Now that's a really simple tree
      Switch wins iff prize door is not picked
        Pr{switch wins} = 2/3
    The tree you come up with to model - may be many models that work
      Often pays off to find simpler tree
  Probability spaces
    Have just been doing examples up until now
    1. Sample space - a countable set S whose elements are called outcomes
    2. Probability function Pr: S -> [0, 1] such that
      sum omega in S Pr{omega} = 1
    The purpose of the "tree model" is to figure out which probability space to use
    Math doesn't start until you have the probability space
    Outcomes = leaves of tree
    Outcome probabilities calculated from branch probabilities
    An even is a subset, E C= S
    Pr{E} ::= sum lomega in E of Pr{lomega}
    Cor: the Sum Rule
      For pairwise disjoint A0, A1,...
      Pr {A0 U A1 U A2 U ....} =
      Pr{A0} + Pr{A1} + Pr{A2} + ...
      Rule we'll be using all the time
      Can be also be treated as an axiom that defines a probability space
    Discrete probability
      Countable sample space
      Combinatorics of finite and countable sets
      Allows sums instead of integrals
        And much simpler theoretical basis
    Derived rules of probability - sure look like sets, proof is the same too
      Difference rule
        Pr[B - A] = Pr[B] - Pr[A int B]
      Inclusion-Exclusion - just like cardinalities of finite sets
        Pr[A U B] = Pr[A] + Pr[B] - Pr[A int B]
      The Union Bound - follows trivially from Inclusion-Exclusion
        Pr[A U B] <= Pr[A] + Pr[B]
      Monotonicity
        If A C= B, then Pr[A] <= Pr[B]
      Boole's Inequality
        For sets A0, A1...
        Pr{for i in N union Ai} <= sum i in N of Pr{A}
        Will get a lot of mileage out of it later on
    Summary, key concepts
      1. Sample space, set S whose elements are outcomes
      2. Probability function: Pr S -> [0, 1] such that
        sum lomega in S of Pr{lomega} = 1
