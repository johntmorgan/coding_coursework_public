K-nearest neighbors
  Classifying grapefruit vs orange
    Clusters on size & color axes
    What if fruit in the middle?
      In example, two neighbors in oranges, 1 in grapefruit
      Probably an orange
      Well that's KNN!
  Recommend movies
    Find users most similar to you
    Once you have a graph of similar users, if one or more likes something
      You probably will too
      (Lol no I like most stuff for idiosyncratic reasons, and every rec engine sucks for me - JM)
  To measure distance between points, use pythagorean theorem
  For Netflix
    Get ratings of 5 different genres
    5 dimensions but distance calc is still sqrt of sum of squares of distances
  What if you want to predict what user will rate a movie, based on neighbors
    Take the average of their ratings
      "Regression"
  So:
    Classification - categorizing into a group
    Regression - predicting a response
  Bakery in Berkeley
    Find 3 closest data points, take their average
  Cosine similarity
    Should distance formula be the way to compare distance?
    Measures angles rather than distance between vectors
      Look it up if using KNN!

Intro to machine learning
  You already just built a recommendation system
  OCR
    Optical character recognition
    Used by Google to digitize books
    Classify a bunch of numbers, and extract features
    Extract features of new number - what are its nearest neighbors?
    How to classify?
      Measure lines, points, curves
    Much more complicated than prior examples
      But it's built on simple ideas like KNN
    Going through images and extracting features = training
      Generally must be trained before executing task
  Spam filter
    Naive Bayes algorithm
      Yes/no training
  Hard to do with machine learning
    Predicting whether stock market goes up or down
    How do you pick good features?
      What it did yesterday? Last month?
    Very hard to predict future with so many variables involved
      (Apparently possible enough with NBA games lol - JM)
