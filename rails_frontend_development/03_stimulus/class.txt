Stimulus has class
  So far have been hard-coding is-hidden inside controller
    Fine for a single short class name
    Better practice to not couple class name to controller
      Specify exact CSS class only in the view
      Stimulus 2.0 does this
  Store class name as special data attribute
    data-<controllerName>-<descriptor>-class

  <section
       id="day-body-<%= schedule_day.day.by_example("2006-01-02") %>"
       data-controller="day-toggle"
       data-day-toggle-hidden-class="is-hidden">

  import { Controller } from "stimulus"

  export default class DayToggleController extends Controller {
    static classes = ["hidden"]
    static targets = ["thingToHide"]

    hiddenClass: string
    thingToHideTarget: HTMLElement

    toggle() {
      this.thingToHideTarget.classList.toggle(this.hiddenClass)
    }
  }

  // Class attributes are usually declared with their associated controller
  // Classes need to be declared in a static variable array of strings classes
    Creates classNameClass and hasClassNameClass properties
  Why do this? Code is a bit more complex
    Decoupled from CSS name
      Don't have to change code with CSS name
      Harder to have a bug
    CSS name now in view
      Designers don't have to look at JS
      Controlled by Rails
      Easier to have a dynamic name
        Say for internationalization
