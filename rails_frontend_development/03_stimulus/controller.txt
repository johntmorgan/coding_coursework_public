Adding Our First Controller
  Most Stimulus code will go through a controller
    Similar to Rails Controller
    Where responses to events are stored
    Much less structured than a Rails controller
      Less expectations
  To invoke a controller
    Add attribute data-controller to DOM element on page
    Value of attribute is name of controller
      Use dash case for >1 word: "fancy-color"
  The controller has the same scope as the DOM element it's attached to
    Any events you want dispatched to the controller must happen inside controller's DOM element
    Any elements that are targets for the controller must also be inside

Ex. Day Show/Hide
  Controller needs to be attached to DOM element encompassing button and all concerts for day

  <section id="day-body-<%= schedule_day.day.by_example("2006-01-02")%>"
  data-controller="day-toggle">

  Now Stimulus looks for matching controller when page loads
    app/javascript/controller/day_toggle_controller.ts

Basic controller
  // ES6 module syntax to import Controller class from stimulus module
  // Using webpack allows the import to work from Simulus module in node_modules directory
    // (more later)
  import { Controller } from "stimulus"

  // Again using ES6 module keywords - export default as expected
  export default class DayToggleController extends Controller {
    // Define method connect (for now)
    // Automatically called when controller instantiated
    connect() {
      console.log("The controller is connected")
    }
  }

  // Load page, message has been printed 6 (!) times
  // Stimulus automatically searches dom for data-controller attributes

A couple points
  Can declare same controller arbitrary number of times in document
    You can even nest the controller inside itself
  A single element can be attached to multiple controllers, separated by spaces
    // ColorController, SizeController, ShapeController
    <div data-controller="color size shape"></div>
