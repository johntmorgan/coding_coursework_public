Stimulus + Haml and Slim
Haml
  Haml generally treats attribute lists as Ruby hashes, so
    %section.day-body{"data-controller": "day-toggle",
      "data-day-toggle-active": "false",
      "data-day-toggle-class-name": "is-hidden"}>

  Need quotes because Ruby symbol literals can't include dashes
  data-controller: "day-toggle" is a syntax error

  Simplify attribute names by nesting hash
  Automatically appends data at front, same result less typing
  Only line break after comma... first line can get long!
    %section.day-body{data: {controller: "day-toggle",
    "day-toggle-active": "false",
    "day-toggle-class-name": "is-hidden"}}>

Slim
  Use attributes directly without Ruby hash, no commas

  section.day-body(data-controller="day-toggle"
  data-day-toggle-active="false"
  data-day-toggle-class-name=is-hidden)>

  Also can do a hash though

  section.day-body(data={controller:"day-toggle",
  "day-toggle-active": "false"
  "day-toggle-class-name": "is-hidden"}>

  Or splat sequence into hash

  %section.day-body*{"data-controller": "day-toggle",
  "data-day-toggle-active": "false",
  "data-day-toggle-class-name": "is-hidden"}>
