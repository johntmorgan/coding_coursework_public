Creating an Action
  Action connects DOM event to controller code to execute
  Add the attribute to the DOM element whose events you want to watch

  <div
      data-action="click->day-toggle#toggle">
    <span> Hide </span>
  </div>

  data-action signals to Stimulus that action is being defined
    Value is a little mini-language to define connection between event and code
      "Action descriptor"
      Name of event being watched for "click", can be any DOM event
      ->
      Name of controller day-toggle# (ends with hash)
      Name of method to be called when event happens
        Usually camelCase
        Here it's toggle

    When Stimulus sees a data-attribute method, it sets up a listener on the event
      Executes named method on controller when event fires
    If multiple instances of controllers withn name, closest ancestor executes

  Default events (aside)
    You can leave off the event name for "default" event - not recommended
      if a, button, input[type="submit"], default is click
        So you can just write day-toggle#toggle
      if input(other), select, textarea
        change
      if form
        submit
    But generally good to keep the event around, not that much extra typing

  Back in the controller

    import { Controller } from "stimulus"

    export default class DayToggleController extends Controller {
      toggle() {
        console.log("Click!")
      }
    }

Now to identify the exact DOM element to hide
  Can use DOM IDs
  But shortcut: Stimulus Action Names

Stimulus Action Names
  Event name in action descriptor can be anything you want, incl. custom events
  Custom events can be a useful way to communicate between controllers
  Can also grab global events
    @window, @document (ready@document)

  const event = new CustomEvent("update-image")
  window.dispatchEvent(event)

  data-action="update-image@window->images#updateImage"

  As with controllers, add multiple actions on same DOM element by adding multiple event descriptors
    Very common
    Great way to split up behavior into small controllers and methods
  Stimulus does pass one argument to methods called
    Of type CustomEvent
    Allows access to the target, the element that hosted the event
    Allows access to currentTarget, element that contains data-action attribute
