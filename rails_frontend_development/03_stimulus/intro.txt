Intro to Stimulus
  Tool with relatively small goals
  "A modest JS framework for the HTML you already have"
  React = replace entire view layer
  Stimulus = handle common JS patterns quickly and without much complication
    Event happens, respond to it
    Simplify process of creating relationship between event and code invoked in response

Without Stimulus
  Use jQuery
  Use no framework, just native DOM methods

Stimulus
  Built by Basecamp
  Lots of convention over configuration, similar to Rails
  Good for small interactions
    Expand existing capabilities
    Don't need much internal state
    e.g. Augmented forms
    Simple navigation
  Opinion
    Web app primarily based on server
    Client provides some interactivity, on top of markup rendered on server
  Key elements
    Controllers - Where code goes, contain methods that are responses to events that happen
    Actions - Declare interested in having Stimulus do something in response to action on page
    Targets - DOM elements of interest to a controller
    Datamaps and Values - State stored in DOM of interest to controller
      Can declare types of values in controller, conflicts a bit with TS
    Classes - Stimulus provides special mechanism for updating
  Uses HTML markup specify HTML/JS interaction
    (Very unlike React - uses its own JSX markup)
    (Also unlike jQuery - keeps JS data outside HTML markup)

This chapter
  Use Stimulus for show-hide button and typeahead search
  Revolves around a few concepts relating HTML markup to JS code
    All items inserted into app by adding data attributes to DOM elements in markup sent to browser
    When page loaded, Stimulus looks for special attributes
      Sets up event listeners behind scenes
      Listeners dispatch events to controller method specified in actions
