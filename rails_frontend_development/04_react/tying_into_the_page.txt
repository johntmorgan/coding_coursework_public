Tying into a page
First let's combine Row components into a Venue
  
  import * as React from "react"
  import Row from "./row"

  interface VenueProps {
    rows: number
    seatsInRow: number
  }

  const Venue = (props: VenueProps) => {
    const rowNumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    const rowItems = rowNumbers.map(rowNumber => {
      return (
        <Row
          key = {rowNumber}
          rowNumber = {rowNumber}
          seatsInRow = {props.seatsInRow}
        />
      )
    })
    return (
      <table className="table">
        <tbody>{rowItems}</tbody>
      </table>
    )
  }

  export default Venue

// Here the venue returns an HTML table
  The props type is a little different
  Basically the structure is similar
  Using map to convert a list of rowNumbers to a list of rowItems
  Cheating by hardcoding the rowNumbers
    We'll see how to get that from Rails in a future chapter

Tying the components in with Webpacker
  Want a top-level pack that will embed in existing DOM
    Different from React apps that take over the entire page

  import * as React from "react"
  import * as ReactDOM from "react-dom"
  import Venue from "../components/venue"

  document.addEventListener("turbolinks:load", () => {
    if (document.getElementById("react-element")) {
      ReactDOM.render(
        <Venue rows={10} seatsInRow={10} />,
        document.getElementById("react-element")
      )
    }
  })

// Install React and ReactDOM - library to interact with DOM
  Then imports Venue component
  Standard DOM event listener
    Waiting for turbolinks:load to signify DOM is complete
    When event fires, checks to see if DOM element to connect exists
      This is a DOM element with "react-element" ID
    If there, calls ReactDOM.render
      This takes two arguments
        The component to render (Venue, with props passed in)
        And a component to render into - same react-element
      Method gives React control over the DOM element that is second arg
      Will use first argument as top-level component to draw
  Replace partial that was rendering seats with simply
    <div id="react-element" />
  Also need to load pack on page
    In layout file app/layouts/application.html.erb
      <%= javascript_pack_tag("venue_display") %>
    Will be downloaded with every page, but Turbolinks means only loaded once per session
      May want to put somewhere else, not ideal from performance perspective
