Intro
  React is most popular of current JS frameworks
  Huge user base, large ecosystem
  Structurally the polar opposite of Stimulus
  More complex
  Different assumptions about how to manage state and logic in JS
  We're only going to use a fraction of React's capabilities in this course
  Focus on supporting interactivity on a single page in Rails
    Not using for a SPA
      Of course reasonable but more complex, less likely to benefit from Rails
      Let's show simpler use cases

What is React?
  JS client-side framework
  Enhance HTML markup with custom JS for complex user interactions
  Uses a mini-language called JSX
    Write HTML-style markup inside JS or TS code
  Stimulus is designed to add interactivity to already written HTML
  With React the markup is written using JSX
    React completely controls what is written to DOM within boundaries
  Internal state diff
    Stimulus keep state in DOM or server
      Update page when state changes
    React keeps state within React system
      When state changes, React runtime loop updates DOM automatically
  Displaying values
    "Declarative" or "Reactive"
    Dev job is to declare what output should look like
    System job is to react to changes in values by redrawing page
  React maintains its own virtual DOM
    Uses virtual DOM to update only the parts of the actual DOM changed when value changes
    React needs to be aware when you change a value relevant to the display
    Only change values in React using specific functions provided by the framework
  React allows you to declare a specific value as part of the changeable state
    Then provides a custom setter function that changes that value
    When you use these setter functions, React notices the state change
      Updates parts of the DOM that are affected by the change in values
  Most code written in React is in a component
    A React component is a function that behaves something like a template
      Combines data with markup written using JSX
      Results in HTML sent to DOM
      JSX allows you to mix JS logic with HTML tags and calls to other React components
