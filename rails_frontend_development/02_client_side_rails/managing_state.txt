Managing State & Front-End
  A lot of decisions about structure are about state management
    Data controlling user-application interaction
    Location of data
    Logic that manipulates state
  Avoid multiple sources of truth
    Do not write same logic on client and server side
  Consistent problem in web dev
    Browser and HTTP server are stateless
    Cookies since almost beginning of web
  Cookies
    Token - random string of chars
    Allow browser to identify self
      Server uses ID to recreate user's state
    Over time, pattern = almost all state on server
      Browser asks for new pages or parts & displays
  RoR
    Designed for managing most app state on server
    Rails built around idea that most web interactions involve a very small set of operations
      CRUD
      create, new, show, index, edit, update, delete
    But basic does not lead to a rich desktop-like experience
