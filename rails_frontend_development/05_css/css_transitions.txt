CSS transitions
  Many ways to chane an elment
  Meta-property is transition

  .background-arrow {
    background-image: url("../images/arrow.svg");
    width: 25px;
    height: 25px;
    transition: all 0.3s ease-in-out;
    // and so on
  }

  Four elements
    First is name of property being observed (or keywords all or none)
      Rotation angle doesn't have a property, so capture using all
      But could limit background-color or margin by being specific
      There's a list of properties
        Any change where steps between values can be listed is fair game
        Properties with discrete enumerated values (display) can't be transitioned
        Can't transition to or from magic values like height or width auto
    Second is amount of time in s or ms
    Third is timing function that determines rate
      linear, ease-in-out (faster in the middle) - more timing functions available
    Last is a delay (not in code)
  Now rotation is animated!

  Transitions don't have to pair with transformations
    Ex. change value on hover pseudo-element

    .js--day-button {
      transition: all 0.3s ease-in-out;

      &:hover {
        background-color: yellow;
      }
    }

    Remove is-primary CSS class from .js--day-button in _schedule_day.html.erb

    How to hide the concert info gradually?
    Can't reliably transition max-height 100% to 0% - changes if width changes
      But can do it with a specific max-height

    .js--day-text {
      transition: all 1s ease-in-out;
      max-height: 1000px;

      &.is-closed {
        opacity: 0;
        max-height: 0px;
      }
    }
