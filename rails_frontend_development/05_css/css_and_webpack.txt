CSS and webpack
  Was tricky to handle initially
  Now about same complexity as using Sprockets
  Default Webpacker allows plain CSS, SASS, SCSS
    SCSS = similar to CSS
    SASS = minimalist similar to Haml
  Using SCSS here
  So far have been using Bulma CSS framework
    Have been importing it directly using a direct link in application.html.erb
  Now let's add it via Webpacker
    yarn add bulma
  Add another library
    yarn add @types/webpack-env -D
  Make sure using the correct version of require, needed for static images
  Import file in app/javascript/packs/application.scss
    Pack all the application.* files into a single pack
    Name application.scss, included in existing application pack
    Add line
      @import '~bulma';
  According to webpacker docs need to add
    <%= stylesheet_pack_tag("application") %>
    (But it just causes an error for me... - JM)
  Can now add custom rules to application.scss
    Can import other files into the applicaion.scss file
    Webpacker has no opinions about how you structure CSS
  As with JS packs, top of page may be manifest of other pages
    Then split those other pages into focused CSS rules
      One for button styling, typography, colors
  Webpack processes CSS with PostCSS
    Parses SASS, SCSS
    Can also do a lot of other post-processing - check the docs
  To get static assets in projects, import
  In application.ts, re-add boilerplate
    const images = require.context("../images", true)
    const imagePath = name => images(name, true)
  First line uses require.context webpack method to add ../images dir to pack
    Directory must exist, or compile fails!
  Second line creates a method called imagePath
    Export or use in other JS code to get name of file
  Now to access any image file
    From JS, use imagePath method just defined
    imagePath("./arrow.png")
  From SCSS can reference image directly
    background-image: url("../images/arrow.svg")
  In a Rails view, two helpers
    asset_pack_path
    image_pack_tag (replacement for image_tag)
      image_pack_tag("media/images/arrow.png")
