Introduction
  Make a website for a client
  Rails still best way for small team to be productive
  Interactive, lots of movement
    Well that means JS
  Which language?
  Lots of languages compile to JS
    TypeScript, Elm, ClojureScript
  Framework
    React
    Vue
    Ember
    Stimulus
    Svelte
    Preact
  How to package code and CSS
    Rails asset pipeline or Webpacker
  Turbolinks?
    Just updated
  RoR 6.1 has lots of tools that interact with JS for great frontend

This course
  Rails front-end tools
    Stimulus, Turbolinks, Webpacker
  JS ecosystem tools
    webpack, TypeScript, React
  Requires Rails basics

Assumptions
  Rails is opinionated - things easier if structure in expected way
    So is this course - does not show you every way to do things
  Going to use JS to enhance Rails
    NOT use JS to build SPA (single page application) that only uses Rails for API
    Why not SPA?
      Rails & browser behavior handle a ton of functionality
      Moving to SPA requires building a lot of functionality yourself
      Front-end frameworks are getting better at handling
        But Rails still less complicated for many apps
    When SPA?
      If UX super different from normal web structure
        Existing behavior of Rails offered by browser is unhelpful
      If backend is already API supporting mobile app or external services
        SPA prevents duplicating view-layer logic
    But generally leveraging Rails view & browser features best way to create great apps
  With these assumptions, still a ton of tools, archs, techs that you could use
    We're going to navigate that space

Let's build an app
  Fictional music fesival North By North South
  Multiple bands perform at various concerts
  App contains a schedule of all concerts and venues
  Not much to it
    Rails scaffolding for minimal administration
    Just to display 2 pages
      Schedule page
      Concert display page
  Schedule page
    Shows concerts, acts, times for festival
    Add features for basic show-hide behavior
      Complex date and search filters
  Concert page
    Simplified theater diagram for each concert
    Select seats for kind of ticket purchase
    More elaborated client-side behavior
      Not just augmented forms
  Data model
    Festival includes several concerts
    Each concert has a venue
    Each venue has a number of rows and number of seats per row
      Yes this is simplified
    Each concert has one or more gigs
    Each gig matches a band to a concert
      Start order
      Duration
    Each concert has a bunch of sold tickets
  Bulma CSS framework
    Attracive
    Adds relatively few class names to markup
    Usually possible to figure out what CSS does from the class names

  Demo does not seem to work - blocked host and adding it to config does nothing... hmmm....
