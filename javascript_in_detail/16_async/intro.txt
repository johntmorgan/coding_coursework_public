What is Async?
  JS is single-threaded
    Only one instruction processed
    Only uses one processor at a time
  But what if
    Function executes without processor
    Instruction in function waiting for network data or disk read
    Do work while waiting

Asynchronicity
  Handle multiple tasks without waiting for blocking code
  Blocking code
    Waiting for network to fetch data
    Waiting for disk to handle data transaction
    Calling sleep in program
    Waiting for user to input data

  function complete(){
    console.log("function completed!");
    return;
  }
  setTimeout(complete, 2000.0); // 2000 = 2 seconds of idle time

  JS is asynchronous
  Will NOT wait for blocking code!

  function complete(){
    console.log("function completed!");
    return;
  }
  setTimeout(complete, 2000.0); // 2000 = 2 seconds of idle time
  console.log("Calling after setTimeout");
    > Calling after setTimeout
    > function completed!
