Recursion
  Calling the same function within its body
  Direct recursion
    Function calls itself directly in its body or definition
  Indirect recursion
    Two or more functions call themselves indirectly from each other

Composition of recursive function
  Base case - where exits
  Recursive case - where calls self again

Main idea
  Solving a subproblem
    Size of subproblem up to you

    function power(base, power)
    {
        if(power === 0){
            return 1;
        }
        else if(power === 1){
            return base;
        }
        else{
            var sub_solution = power_helper(base, power -1);
            var solution =  sub_solution * base;
            return solution;
        }
    }

Visualization
  Every function invocation is costly
    Pushed onto call stack
  Stack error when stack limit exceeded
  Recursion is clean, but can cause stack error
    Look into trampoline & tail-call with lots of data
