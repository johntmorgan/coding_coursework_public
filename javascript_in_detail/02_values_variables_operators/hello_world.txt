console.log("hello world!");

Note
  Trailing semicolon not necessary in JS
  Removing does not throw error
  But allows multi-line code in same line, acting as separator

Call console object
Call console object method log

Console object is part of DOM objects family available to JS language
  Will print anything passed to it as argument
  Automatic new line characters
  If that's a problem, use process object instead
    process.stdout.write
    Gives more control - writes exactly what told
  There are many more global objects available besides console and process
  We will use console though
  Console uses process object to log anything into terminal
