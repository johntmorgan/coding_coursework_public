Operators
  Five main types
    Arithmetic
    Comparison
    Logical
    Assignment
    Conditional

  Arithmetic
    +, - , *, /, %
    ** exponentiation
    ++ increment
    -- decrement

    Numbers are primitives and immutable
    ++ and -- create a new value and assign to same variable

  Comparison
    == regardless of type
    !- regardless of type
    === "strict equal" must have same type
    !== "strict not equal" must have same type
    >, < , >=, <=
    Do not do => , this is fat arrow notation used to declare function

  Logical
    &&, ||, !

  Assignment
     = assigns left to right
     += assigns value sum of left and right to left
     -=
     *=
     /=
     %=

  Conditional/ternary
    var var1 = <condition> ? <value if true> : <value if false>
