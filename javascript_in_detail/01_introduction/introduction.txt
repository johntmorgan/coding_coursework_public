Introduction
  JS is a programming language for the web
  Syntax based on Java and C
  Used both front end and back end
  Animated/interactive objects on web, odds are JS involved
  Current most popular coding language

  Who is JS for?
    Built as a scripting, language, but now:
    Interactive web pages
    Mobile applications
    Browser extensions
    Creating back-end for servers

  Many great features
    Prototype-based OOP system
    Type coercion
    Functional programming
    Asynchronous programming
    Input validation
    Event handling

How compilation works
  Compiled and executed by Javascript Engines
    Interpretation
    JIT (just in time compilation)
  Originally was interpreted language
  Interpretation is slow
  Recent JS engines have adopted JIT
    Chrome V8 famous

JIT compilation
  Translates source code at run time to machine language before executing
  Uses profiler to avoid re-translating code segments
    Faster than interpretation
  How
    Source code parsed into AST (abstract syntax tree)
    AST used to create bytecode - at run-time
    Bytecode translated into machine code - at run-time
    Machine code executed
