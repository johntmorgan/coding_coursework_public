Static and dynamic type checking
  Static type checking
    Most generic
    Occurs before code is run
      C++, Go
    JS cannot use this technique
      TypeScript or Flow used instead
  Dynamic
    Checked and assigned during run time
    Interpreted/JIT compiler

  var a = 1 + "1"; // works fine

  Works not because dynamic type checking, but because weakly-typed

  Weakly-typed
    Make conversions between unrelated types implicitly

  Strongly-typed
    Does not allow implicit conversions
      Python would throw a type mismatch error
