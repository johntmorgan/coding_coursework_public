Interview process in general - what to expect
  All processes are different
  Generally
    Initial screening
      Recruiter
      Basic requirements
      Easy screening questions
        "What is CSS?"
      Schedule next interview
      Time to ask questions
        About process
          Good idea
            Jumped to coding interview - ask how many questions
    Personality interview
      Manager, CEO if startup
      Workplace behavior
      How do you respond to e.g. conflict
      Company culture fit
        Some value long hours, above and beyond
        Some work-life balance
        How do you feel about those things
    Coding challenge - our focus today
      With engineers, engi manager
      Problem solving
      Or system architecture question
      May be a take-home element (heard less lately due to ChatGPT?)
        May be written or whiteboard
      Want clean code
      Not always hung up on efficiency, but want to know how react in real world

What is leetcode?
  Allows you to practice your programming skills by solving coding questions
    Sometimes will say from xyz company
  Big-O notation
    Way to measure how slow or fast algorithm is
    How degrade or change - how scalable
    If solution works for small data set, that's great
      But what about when the data set grows?
    Often comes down to loops
      Doing nested loops? Be careful!
      Watch out for O(n^2)

Let's do this in ~5 groups (26 people present)
  Stick with easy problems to make sure can get done on time
