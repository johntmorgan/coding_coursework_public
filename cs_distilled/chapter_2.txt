Exponential and factorial time needed for NP-complete problems
  See next chapter
  Selection sort, bubble sort = O(n^2)
  Find a non-exponential solution to NP-complete algorithm?
    Win $1m! From Clay Mathematics Institute
    Can be generalized to all problems
    If you prove it's impossible, also win $1m
