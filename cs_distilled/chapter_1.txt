Flowcharts
  States and instruction steps -> rectangles
  Decision steps -> diamonds
  Connect steps with arrows
  Mark beginning and end (rounded rectangles?)

Operators
  A -> B if a is true, b is implied to be true
  Every conditional expression has a contrapositive
  !B -> !A
  But A -> B does not guarantee B -> A "inverse error"
  Unless you use the biconditional: "if and only if"
  (and, or, xor review)

Boolean algebra
  Associativity
    (A and B) and C = A and (B and C)
    (A or B) or C = A or (B or C)
  Distributivity
    A and (B or C) = (A and B) or (A and C)
    A or (B and C) = (A or B) and (A or C)
  DeMorgan's Law
    !(A and B) = !A or !B
    !A and !B = !(A or B)

Permutations
  Order n objects in n! ways

Permutations with duplication
  N object
  R repeats
  N!/R!
  R2 more repeats
  N!/(R!*R2!)

Combinations
  N objects
  M selections
  N!/(M! * (N - M)!)
