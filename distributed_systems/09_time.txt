Time
Main use case: to determine order of different events
  Can mean very different things in practice
Examples
  Impose order to requests received concurrently by clients to determine order
  Sysadmin investigate incident looking at system logs, order by timestamp
Dist systems
  Centralized systems have a single clock
    Maintain illusion of universal time dimension
  Dist system
    Each node has clock
    Clocks may run at diff rate or granularity
      Clocks will drift apart
    No global clock
Practical
  Clocks in real systems physical clocks
Physical clock
  Physical process coupled with measuring method to record passage of time
  Usually based on cyclic processes
    Sundial
    Hourglass
    Pendulum
    Quartz clock
      Uses crystal that vibrates/ticks with frequency when electricity applied
    Atomic clock
      Among most accurate
      Uses frequency of electronic transitions in certain atoms
  May have errors in both measurement and physical processes
    Will always be a skew no matter how often synchronized
Global clock, distributed systems
  Must take diffs between clocks into account
    Do not assume all same, operate as global clock
    Node with slow clock -> looks like event happened earlier
  Best we can do is accept clocks will not always agree between nodes
    Expose uncertainty
      Spanner - TrueTime API - uses intervals instead of timestamps
Theoretical perspective
  So far dealing with practical, simplified notion of time
  There is an absolute notion of time
    Impossible to measure it completely precisely, does not hold in reality
  Physics
    Special theory of relativity
      Impossible to absolutely state two events happen at same time if separated in space
        Events in London, NYC, will appear to happen diff time if traveling London -> NYC
    Train experiment
      Observer in middle of train, observer of platform
      Flash of light in middle of train
        Observer in train: reach both ends at same time
        Observer outside: reach rear faster as rear is traveling towards it
  Information in universe generally travels via light - limited by speed of light
    In distributed system, depends on underlying infrastructure of network
      Might not be able to flow at all due to network partition
Logical clocks
  Non-physical category of clocks
    Use messages exchanged between nodes of a system
    Can return events by counter rather than precise timestamp
