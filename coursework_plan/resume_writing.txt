Your resume is one of few tools to get noticed
Average recuiter only looks for 6 seconds
That's how long you have to catch their attention

Tip 1. Don't get too creative
Imagine if everyone had a different driver's license!
  What a mess at the bar.
Keep resume in one page
But don't be afraid to add a personal touch
  If you have traveled to a ton of countries, mention it

Tip 2.
Don't be too shy about your achievements
Don't be too humble in this spot
Mention your team - teamwork is important
But make sure to mention what you did
DON'T claim you're an expert explicitly
  Your resume should indicate that
  And it's hard to be a true expert
  And your interviewer may also be an expert
    They're going to really grill you
Don't lie ffs

Tip 3.
Don't just list your responsibilities
  Don't just copy-paste job description
  Show what you actually achieved
  Use the STAR technique
  situation, task, action, result
    Break position into 3 sections - sit/task, action, result

Tip 4.
  Prioritize sections and be consistent
  Student? Education at top
  Beginner? Limited experience, education at top
  Experienced? Skills and experience at top, education falls below

Tip 5.
  Keep the tone consistent
  If you like machine learning, they should get that from the resume
  If you like web dev, etc etc.
  It's ok to drop some projects and work experience in favor of consistency
