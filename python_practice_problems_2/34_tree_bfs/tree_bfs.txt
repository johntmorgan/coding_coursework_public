Tree Breadth-First Search
  Important for finding node in tree that satisfies constraints
  Start at root, move down level by level
    Explore adjacent nodes at k + 1
  Good for finding neighbor nodes
    Peer to peer networking

Pattern matching
  Yes
    Solution probably near root of tree
    Must traverse tree one level at a time
      May need to find level order traversal
  No
    Tree is very wide
    Solution near leaves of tree

Real-world
  Traversing DOM Tree I
    HTML can be represented in tree structure
    Children of HTML tags -> children of node
    Traverse nodes level by level
  Traversing DOM Tree II
    Create a shadow tree for DOM
    Each node has pointer to next node on right on same level
    Avoid queue data structure, stay space efficient
