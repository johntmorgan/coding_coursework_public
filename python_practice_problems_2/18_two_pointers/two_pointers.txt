Two pointers
  Use two pointers to iterate over array, list
  Keep track of two different indexes in iteration
  Whenever requirement to find two elements satisfying condition
  Can iterate in one or both directions
  String a palindrome?
    Use one pointer from beginning, one from end
      Compare values at each step
    Better than naive solution, nested loop O(n^2)
      Instead is O(n)
  Essentially application of prune-and-search

Examples
  Reversing an array
  Pair with given sum in sorted array

Pattern matching
  Input data can be traversed in linear fashion
    Array, linked list, char string
  Data sorted, or arranged in fashion relevant to problem
    Numeric data in asc/desc order
    Chars symmetric
  Only considering two elements in the input data

Not pattern match:
  Data cannot be traversed linearly
  Problem requires exhaustive search of solution space

Real-world
  Transmission errors
    Can tolerate at most one deviance to a diversion router
    Path back to router recorded in array inside packet
    Use 2P to determine whether same path followed
