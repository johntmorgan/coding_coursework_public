Hash Maps
  Method to store data
  Reduce time taken to find and access values
  Store in form of key-value pairs
  Arrays
    Keys known as indexes
    Cannot pick value of keys
      Always sequential integers from 0
    If do not know index, must search entire array
      O(n)
  Hash maps
    Flexible keys
    Each key unique
    Look up in O(1) time
  Storage
    Arrays
      Student name:grade
      Must be at same place in each array
      O(n) to find
      Then O(1) to access spot in second array
    Hash map:
      Name as key, grade as value
      One lookup in O(1) time

Pattern match
  Yes
    Repeated fast access to data
    Store relationship between two sets of data
    (No extrinsic order to track - JM)
  No
    No useful relation between two sets of data

Real world
  Telecoms
    Phone book, name as key number as value
  E-commerce
    Search for product detail using product ID as key
  File system
    Store file name : path
