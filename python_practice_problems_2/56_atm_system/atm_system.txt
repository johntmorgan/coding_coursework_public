  How to handle cash withdrawal?
    Need to withdraw the correct bill combinations
    Work sequentially until amount met

  Chain of Responsibility design pattern
    CashWithdrawProcessor
    HundredDollarWithdrawProcessor
    TwentyDollarWithdrawProcessor
    FiveDollarWithdrawProcessor

    $100 proc starts - return remainder
    then passed to $20
    then $5
    (then $1 if needed)

Sequencing: balance inquiry
  Cardholder inserts card
  ATM asks for PIN
  Cardholder enters PIN
  ATM sends code to card issuer
  If verified
    Main menu displayed
    Cardholder selects balance inquiry
    ATM requests balance from card issuer
    Card issuer returns balance
    ATM displays balance
    ATM asks if receipt should be printed
      Yes: print receipt via printer
      No: ATM card ejected
        (Not back to main screen? - JM)
  Else
    Card ejected
      (Really they ask again though - JM)
