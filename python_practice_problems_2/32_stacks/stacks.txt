Stacks
  Linear data structure
  LIFO
  Push & pop operations
  Element can only be added to top, unlike list
  Used to store sequentially dependent items
    Nature and correlation determined by programmer
  Repeatedly modify stream of elements
    Push elements on, pop when conditions met

Patterns
  Yes
    Get elements out in reverse of insert order (LIFO)
  No
    FIFO order required
    Order of outputs/operations not significant

Real world
  Checking code files
    Balanced parens?
  Undo/redo functionality
  Recursive call stacks
    Compiler calls stack itself internally
