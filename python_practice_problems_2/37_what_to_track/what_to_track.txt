What to track
  Mostly frequency counts
  Avoid O(n^2) by simplifying problem
    Identify key numeric properties in data
  Often used with array & strings
    Solve counting data freqs, return booleans
  Often solvable with comparison & checks
    Check if first array values have squared in second array
    Check if 2 strings are anagrams
    Check if player wins game
  Hashmaps to store frequency count
    Allow search & retrieval of data in O(1)
  Sometimes not hashmaps
    Separate arrays or vars to store freq counts

Pattern matching
  Yes
    Problem seems hard with naive O(n^2)
    Often - boolean output, True/False, Player 1/Player 2, etc.
    Key characteristics
      Freq of chars in string
      Pattern of generation of seq of permutations
      Implications of given move in game like tic-tac-toe or chess
  No
    Can't identify key chars to simplify
    Need to locate element, not just give True/False etc.
      Say need to return all palindromic permutations
