Divide & conquer with binary search
  Algorithmic paradigm
  Divide problem into subproblems
  Reach point where each subproblem is similar and atomic
  Solve atomic problems
  Merge problem solutions
  Binary search example - O(logn) vs O(n)

Pascal's Triangle
  Triangular array of binomial coefficients
  Start with a 1 on top
  Place numbers in subsequent rows to make triangular pattern

        current_line[0] = 1
        return current_line
    else:
        current_line = [0] * current_line_size
        previous_line = pascal_triangle_recursive(line_number - 1, space + 1)∂∂
        for numIndex in range(current_line_size):
