Modified Binary Search
  Uses binary search to find target in array
  Divide array in half through start, end, middle pointers
  O(log(n)) time
    Better than brute-force O(n) search

Pattern match
  Yes:
    Find target value (or first/last occurrence)
      Sorted list
        or sequential range
      Array may have 2 different sorted sections, etc.
  No:
    Data is not sorted in relevant fashion
    Not searching for value in data

Real world
  Dictionary: alphabetically sorted words
  Debugging: Divide code by line numbers
  Student docs: Sort by roll number
