Merge Intervals
  Overlapping interval problems
  Interval represented by start and end time
  [10, 20] - start at 10, end at 20
  Used mostly for scheduling problems

Key to understanding: 6 different ways 2 intervals may overlap
  1 completely overlaps 2
  2 completely overlaps 1
  1 completely in front of 2
  2 completely in front of 1
  1 partially in front of 2
  2 partially in front of 1

Pattern matching
  Yes:
    Input is array of intervals
    Dealing with overlapping intervals
      Find intersection
      Find union
      Find gaps
  No:
    Order of intervals is not significant
    Input list of intervals is not sorted
      Inefficient, will solve another way
