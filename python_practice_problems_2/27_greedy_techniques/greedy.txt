Greedy Techniques
  Build up solution piece by piece
  Make locally optimal choice
    Hope leads to globally optimal solution
  Optimization problems
  Can get stuck in local optima
    Generally do not return global best solution

Pattern
  Yes
    Select local optima then construct global solution
  No
    Local greedy choices clearly = sub-optimal solution
    No local optima
    Not an optimization problem

Real-world
  CPU scheduling
  LAN networks
    Find MST to ensure minimum packet transmission
