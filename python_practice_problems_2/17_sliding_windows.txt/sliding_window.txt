Sliding window
  Computational method
  Reduce use of nested loops
  Variation of two pointers pattern
  Pointers used to set window bounds
  Window is a sublist over part of an iterable data structure
  Process data in segments, not entire list
  Set window size depending on requirements
    Need to find 3 consec integers with largest sum, set window to 3

Is problem suitable?
  Yes:
    Repeated computations on contiguous data elements
      Subarray, substring
    Window moves across array from one end to the other
    Size of window may be fixe dor variable
    Repeated comps may be direct part of soln or intermediate step building
    Computations performed every time the window moves tak O(1)
      Or slow growing function, say log of small variable, k << n
  No:
    Input data structure does not support random access
    Must process entire data w/o segmentation
