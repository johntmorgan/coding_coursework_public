Topological Sort
  Find valid orderings of items
    Dependencies on each other
    Priority over each other
  Scheduling and grouping problems
    Prereqs and dependencies
  Can be described as a partial order
    (vs sorting an array - complete order)
    Say 3 courses, take prereq first, but course without prereq can go anywhere
  Convert to directed graph
    Valid order exists if acyclic

Pattern matching
  Yes
    Partial ordering required
    Find ordering based on dependency rules
  No
    Total ordering required
    Cannot convert to graph
    Graph created is not a tree

Real world
  Process scheduling in computer system
    Take account of dependencies
    Cannot have circular dependencies
