Cyclic Sort
  In place comparison sort algorithm
  Array divided into cycles
  Each element is rotated to create sorted array
  Deals with problems involving arrays w/numbers in certain range
    Usually unsorted
    Usually need to find missing/duplicate in range

Pattern matching
  Yes
    Input array has a cycle - duplicate numbers
    Problem asks to find missing number in a range
  No
    Problem not based on integer numbers
    Input data not in array, can't be mapped
    Given data not in [1 - n] range, where n is array size

Real world
  Computational biology
    n genes
    Find kth missing gene
  Error checking
    Network transmission error
    Number in known range misinterpreted as different number in range
    Find number caused by error, number misinterpreted
