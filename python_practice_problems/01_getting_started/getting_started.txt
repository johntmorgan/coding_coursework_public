Why Design Patterns
  Interviews are hard
  Never know what question asked
    So many
    Need to reach optimal solution
  Good news though
  Handful of patterns that can help
    Blueprint that solves many related problems
    Avoid rote memorization

This course
  175 popular coding interview questions
  24 design patterns
  CW: go through 100-200 hard questions for interview
    Without conceptual basis, just exam cramming
  Goal: build up robust conceptual framework
  Each lesson presents both logic and implementation
    Multiple interactive elements
  Each pattern has ~5 problems each
    Cat A: step by step solution construction
    Cat B: deep dive into solution
    Cat C: brief overview of solution
      Training wheels coming off
    Cat D: test skill in applying techniques
      Just clues and tips
  Challenge yourself chapter
    Set of advanced questions
      Common at top tech companies
  Each problem is a pair
    Problem statement
    Solution
  Exceptions: Cat D, Challenge Yourself
  Also provide code templates
    Use at your discretion

Complexity note
  Do not count space taken in memory by input data or output data
    When comparing solutions, this is always the same
