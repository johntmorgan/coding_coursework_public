Modified binary search
  Divide in half, start/middle/end pointers
  If mid > target, then move end to left of mid
  If mid < target, move end to right of mid
  O(log(n))

Pattern
  Sorted array or sequential range
    Or at least portions - maybe 2 sections
  Find target (or first/last occurrence)

Real-world
  Dictionary - find word
  Debugging - divide code in half
