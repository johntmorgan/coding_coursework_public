Two Pointers
  Use two pointers to iterate over array or list
  Keep track of values at indexes in single iteration
  Think of it
    Find two data elements in array that satisfy condition
  Iterate one or both directions
  Ex. palindrome
    Naive O(n^2) nested loops
    O(n) with single pointers
  Other examples
    Reverse array O(n) - swap and move
    Pair with sum in sorted array

Pattern matching
  Yes
    Traverse data linearly - array, linked list, string
    Input data sorted, or arranged in relevant fashion
    Only consider two elements in data, not all
  No
    Input data not linear traverse
    Exhaustive search required

Real world
  Network protocol
    Response packets take same route in reverse back to source
    Path may differ due to errors
    Can tolerate at most one diversion router
    Path recorded in array
    Two pointers used to find diversion
