Sliding Window
  Reduce use of nested loops in algo
  Two pointers variation
    Pointers set window bounds
  Window = sublist
    Slide over data in chunks
    Process data in segments
  Not more efficient if iterate over all elements of each window
    Focus on element leaving, element entering
  Examples
    Sliding window median
    Max subarray sum

Pattern match
  Yes
    Repeated computation contiguous set of data elements
    Computations when moving are O(1), O(logn), etc.
  No
    Random access not supported
    Process entire structure, no segmentation

Real world
  Max users connected to base station in k-ms sliding window
  How many times products viewed by user appear in data
  Calculate buffering events in 1-min interval
  Find short sequence of posts by users including topics another posted about
