Fast and slow pointers
  Traverse iterable data structure at diff speeds
    Usually fast by 2, slow by 1
  Commonly used in cycle detection
  Example
    Delete nth node from end of list
      Space and then advance
      When fast off end, delete slow

Pattern matching
  Yes
    Find first x % in linked list
    Find element at k-way point in linked list
      Or middle element
      Or element at start of Q2
    Find kth last element
    Detect cycle in linked list
    Detect cycle in sequence of symbols

Real world
  Symlink
    Avoid loops in shortcuts to different files
  OOP compile
    Avoid cyclic dependencies
