What to Track
  Frequency counts usually, to avoid O(n^2)
  Array & strings
    Boolean T/F return
    Count data frequencies
  Values in array corresponding squared in second?
  Strings anagrams?
  If player wins game?
  Hashmaps store frequency count

Pattern matching
  Hard with naive O(n^2)+ approach
  Can track data to solve efficiently
  Often when choose from T/F, P1/P2, etc.
