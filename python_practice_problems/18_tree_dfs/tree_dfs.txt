Tree depth-first search
  Graph with properties
    Undirected
    Acyclic
    Single connected component
  Tree dfs
    Reduce nested loops
    Usually implement recursively
    Can implement iteratively with stack
  Go as far as possible down one branch before others
  Three main patterns
    Preorder
      Node
      Left child
      Right child
      Most common
    In order
      Left child
      Node
      Right child
      When finding elements smaller than root
    Postorder
      Left child
      Right child
      Node
      Rarest
      Ex. deleting tree
  Why?
    Restart at root -> O(n^2)
    Use dfs -> O(n)
  DFS vs BFS
    Prefer DFS if answer close to leaf
    BFS is answer close to root
