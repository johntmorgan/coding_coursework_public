Dynamic Programming
  Recursive divide and conquer
  If optimal substructure, solve smaller to solve bigger
  May be overlapping subproblems
  To solve:
    Top down with memoization
      Store solved subproblems in array or hash map
    Bottom up with tabulation
      Avoid recursion
      n-dimensional array to store results
      May require 2d arrays
        Optimize with 1d, same array for previous and next comp
          Tricky, not always applicable
