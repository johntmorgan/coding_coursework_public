React Lifecycle and Lifecycle Methods
  This is not comprehensive, just an intro to some important ones
  Every React component goes through a lifecycle
  Lifecycle methods are React functions used to control what happens
    when each bit of UI renders, updates, considers re-render, disappears

  componentWillMount()
    Invoked before component mounted on DOM
    Happens once in lifecycle of component, before first render
    Ex. may request server for user information before mounting
      However React doc says to use constructor() for initializations before rendering
        Says componentWillMount() unsafe, avoid in new code

  componentDidMount()
    Invoked when component mounted on DOM
    Initialize state and props required in DOM, requesting info from server

  componentDidUpdate()
    Invoked when component is updated
    Send requests to server for any update in state or props required for DOM

  componentWillUnmount()
    Invoked when component is removed from DOM
    Clear up things relatd to component
      Ex. user logs out, clear credentials and other auth tokens for security
