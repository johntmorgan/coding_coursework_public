Left and right joins


  SELECT FirstName, SecondName, AssetType, URL
  FROM Actors
  LEFT JOIN DigitalAssets
  ON Actors.Id = DigitalAssets.ActorID;

  // This changes it
  // Actors without digital assets are left out

  SELECT FirstName, SecondName, AssetType, URL
  FROM DigitalAssets
  LEFT JOIN Actors
  ON Actors.Id = DigitalAssets.ActorID;

  // Very similar result - the same as the second query
  // Like doing a left join on digital assets

  SELECT FirstName, SecondName, AssetType, URL
  FROM Actors
  RIGHT JOIN DigitalAssets
  ON Actors.Id = DigitalAssets.ActorID;

  // Can also say LEFT OUTER JOIN and RIGHT OUTER JOIN
  // Makes absolutely no difference in result - just another syntax option
