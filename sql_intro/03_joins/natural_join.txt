Natural Join
  Syntactic sugar
  Tries to find the natural join by matching columns with same name
    Inner join

  // Returns actor names with all their URLs
  // Result is a cartesian product - ActorID and ID do not match
  SELECT FirstName, SecondName, AssetType, URL
  FROM Actors
  NATURAL JOIN DigitalAssets;

  // Now let's make the column names match
  ALTER TABLE DigitalAssets CHANGE ActorId Id INT;

  SELECT FirstName, SecondName, AssetType, URL
  FROM Actors
  NATURAL JOIN DigitalAssets;

  // Results are the same as doing the inner join

  SELECT FirstName, SecondName, AssetType, URL
  FROM Actors
  INNER JOIN DigitalAssets USING (Id);

  // Natural left and right joins also possible

  SELECT FirstName, SecondName, AssetType, URL
  FROM Actors
  NATURAL LEFT OUTER JOIN DigitalAssets;

  // Nothing magical about the natural join
  // Just syntactic sugar implicitly finding columns to join the tables
  // Ideally avoid natural join
    Hides columns that will be used for join
    Can subtly introduce bugs
      What if extra column match introduced by changing a col name?
