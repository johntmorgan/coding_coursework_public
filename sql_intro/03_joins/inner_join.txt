Inner Joins
  Made another table DigtalAssets
    Has actor social media
    ActorId column
    URL is primary key - guaranteed unique
    Col names in two tables are different

  SELECT FirstName, SecondName, AssetType, URL
  FROM Actors
  INNER JOIN DigitalAssets
  ON Actors.Id = DigitalAssets.ActorID;

  // If both had the same col name for actor ID then

  SELECT FirstName, SecondName, AssetType, URL
  FROM Actors
  INNER JOIN DigitalAssets
  USING(Id);

  // Note all col names are distinct
  // If not then need to disambiguate with table name
    Actors.FirstName I assume - JM

  // Don't need to do inner join clause to get inner join
  // Use WHERE clause for same effect
  // No difference in performance, just a matter of taste
  SELECT FirstName, SecondName, AssetType, URL
  FROM Actors, DigitalAssets
  WHERE ActorId=Id;

  // Cartesian product - two syntaxes
  SELECT FirstName, SecondName, AssetType, URL
  FROM Actors, DigitalAssets;

  SELECT FirstName, SecondName, AssetType, URL
  FROM Actors
  INNER JOIN DigitalAssets;

  // Can join any two columns with same type
  // Or which can be converted into each other with data loss
  // This example is non-sensical and returns no results
  SELECT *
  FROM Actors
  INNER JOIN DigitalAssets ON URL = FirstName;

  // Also no results
  SELECT *
  FROM Actors
  INNER JOIN DigitalAssets
  ON NetWorthInMillions = ActorId;
