Union
  Combine results from several queries together
  Does not join tables
  Clubs results together

  // Results in a big list of actor first names and URLs
  SELECT FirstName FROM Actors
  UNION
  SELECT URL FROM DigitalAssets;

  // Make a list of full names of richest, poorest actors in list
  // Queries must be wrapped by parens when using ORDER BY or LIMIT in UNION subqueries
  (SELECT CONCAT(FirstName, ' ', SecondName) AS "Actor Name"
  FROM Actors
  ORDER BY NetworthInMillions DESC
  LIMIT 2)

  UNION

  (SELECT CONCAT(FirstName, ' ', SecondName) AS "ThisAliasIsIgnored"
  FROM Actors
  ORDER BY NetworthInMillions ASC
  LIMIT 2);

  When using Union, two result sets should have same num, order of columns

  // Error
  SELECT FirstName, Id FROM Actors

  UNION

  SELECT FirstName FROM Actors;

  // Can insert null column

  SELECT FirstName, Id FROM Actors

  UNION

  SELECT FirstName, null FROM Actors;

  // Result does not output duplicate values
  SELECT MaritalStatus FROM Actors

  UNION

  SELECT Gender FROM Actors;

  > Just single instance of each marital status, gender

  // To show all duplicates use UNION ALL

  SELECT MaritalStatus FROM Actors

  UNION ALL

  SELECT Gender FROM Actors;

  // UNION may ignore ORDER BY when used without LIMIT

  (SELECT CONCAT(FirstName, ' ', SecondName) AS "Actor Name"
  FROM Actors
  ORDER BY NetworthInMillions DESC  LIMIT 2)

  UNION

  (SELECT NetworthInMillions
  FROM Actors
  ORDER BY NetworthInMillions ASC);
    > The net worth results are not ordered!

  // Tacking on a limit fixes this

  (SELECT CONCAT(FirstName, ' ', SecondName) AS "Actor Name"
  FROM Actors
  ORDER BY NetworthInMillions DESC  LIMIT 2)

  UNION

  (SELECT NetworthInMillions
  FROM Actors
  ORDER BY NetworthInMillions ASC LIMIT 3);
