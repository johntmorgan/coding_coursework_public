Self inner join
  Inner join is simplest join

  // Cartesian product
  // Every row joined with every other row
  // 11 row table makes 121 rows
  SELECT * FROM Actors a INNER JOIN Actors b;

  // Now 11 rows, column joined on FirstName
  SELECT * FROM Actors a INNER JOIN Actors b USING(FirstName);

  // But if pick col with duplicates, see a Cartesian join for dupe rows
  // Here 2 actors have net worth 240, so brad-brad, brad-jennifer, jennifer-brad, jennifer-jennifer
  SELECT * FROM Actors a INNER JOIN Actors b USING(NetWorthInMillions);

  // If any rows from tables don't match, not included in inner join
    Will not happen in case of self-join, obviously
