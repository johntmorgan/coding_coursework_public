Joins
  Relational dbs define relationships between tables
  Often need to glean info from more than one table
  Joins allow row combination from multiple tables
    Use columns in common
  Relations amongst tables = relational databases

  Let's define 2 tables, both of which have a MovieID column

5 kinds of joins
  ANSI SQL standard

Cross Join
  aka Cartesian product
  Pick the first row of table A
  Match with every row of table B
  Then pick the second row of A, match with every row of B
  No condition specified to determine if join
    Just make all possible joins

Inner Join
  1+ conditions tested to determine if join
    "Join predicate"
  In example, join rows with same MovieID

Left Outer Join
  Rows that match join predicate
  PLUS rows from table on left that don't match join
    Null is inserted for cols from table B and rows from table A that don't match

    1 Star Wars       NULL  NULL  NULL
    2 Sholay          2 Naz Cinema  101
    3 The Italian Job NULL  NULL  NULL

Right Outer Join
  The referse of the left outer join

  2 Sholay    2 Naz Cinema  101
  NULL  NULL  5 Apollo Theater  45

Full Outer Join
  ** MySQL does not support! **
  Fill in all rows that do not match predicate

  1 Star Wars         NULL  NULL  NULL
  2 Sholay            2 Naz Cinema  101
  3 The Italian Job   NULL  NULL  NULL
  NULL  NULL          5 Apollo Theater  45

Self join
  Table joined to itself

  1 Star Wars       1 Star Wars
  2 Sholay          2 Sholay
  3 The Italian Job 3 The Italian Job
