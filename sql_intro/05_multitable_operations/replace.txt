REPLACE
  Much like INSERT
  But cannot insert row if table already has row with same primary key
  Replace allows adding row with same primary key as existing row in table
  Under the hood, REPLACE deletes the row and then adds the new row
    Maintains primary key constraint at all times
    Of course you could use UPDATE to achieve same effect
    REPLACE useful in automated scripts - don't know if primary key will be present
      Acts like an INSERT or update as appropriate

  REPLACE INTO
  Actors (Id, FirstName, SecondName,DoB, Gender, MaritalStatus, NetworthInMillions)
  VALUES (3, "George", "Clooney", "1961-05-06","Male", "Married", 500.00);

  // What if values not replaced?
  // Other fields all set to NULL
  REPLACE INTO
  Actors (Id)
  VALUES (3);

  // If a table has no primary key, REPLACE behaves exactly like INSERT
    Don't know which row to replace
  // Can't replace into a table being read from in subquery
  // Error:
  REPLACE INTO Actors
  SET id = (Select Id
            FROM Actors
            WHERE FirstName = "Brad");
