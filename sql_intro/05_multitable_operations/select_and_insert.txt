SELECT and INSERT
  Populate data from a table into another table

  // Let's make a table with all the second names of actors
  CREATE TABLE Names (name VARCHAR(20), PRIMARY KEY(name));

  // Now insert using INSERT and SELECT
  INSERT INTO Names(name) SELECT SecondName FROM Actors;

  // Note that it isn't guaranteed there are no duplicates
  // Error if try to insert duplicate
  INSERT INTO Names(name) SELECT SecondName FROM Actors WHERE Id=1;

  // Can bypass error and continue execution with IGNORE
  // Row is *not* added
  // MySQL issues a warning instead of error -> abort
  INSERT IGNORE INTO Names(name)
  SELECT SecondName
  FROM Actors WHERE Id = 1;
    > Records: 1 Duplicates: 1 Warnings: 1

  // Creating and inserting in a single shot
  CREATE TABLE MyTempTable SELECT * FROM Actors;

  // All the modifiers you'd use in a create table statement may be used
  CREATE TABLE NamesWithDoBs (
  Id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
  Name VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT "unknown",
  DoB DATE,
  PRIMARY KEY(Id), KEY(Name), KEY(DoB)) SELECT FirstName, DoB FROM Actors;

  // Copy existing table with no data using LIKE
  // Contains no data but structure is exactly the same
  CREATE TABLE CopyOfActors LIKE Actors;
