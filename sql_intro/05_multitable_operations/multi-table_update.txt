Multi-Table Update
  Very similar to delete syntax

  Let's convert the FirstName and SecondName strings to upper case for actors on Facebook
  Also convert Facebook URL to uppercase

  UPDATE
  Actors INNER JOIN DigitalAssets
  ON Id = ActorId
  SET FirstName = UPPER(FirstName), SecondName = UPPER(SecondName), URL = UPPER(URL)
  WHERE AssetType = "Facebook";

  // Another version with a WHERE clause

  UPDATE Actors, DigitalAssets
  SET FirstName = UPPER(FirstName), SecondName = UPPER(SecondName), URL = UPPER(URL)
  WHERE AssetType = "Facebook"
  AND ActorId = Id;

  // As with delete, cannot update table read from in subquery
  // ORDER BY and LIMIT also can't be used, again
    (I think - text actually says delete, think it's a typo - JM)
