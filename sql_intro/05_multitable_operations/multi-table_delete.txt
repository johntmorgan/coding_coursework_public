Multi-Table Delete
  Want to delete data from one table AND related data from other tables
  Let's delete DigitalAssets along with an Actor

  // Old Syntax
  DELETE T1, T2
  FROM T1, T2, T3
  WHERE <condition>;

  // New Syntax, reads better
  DELETE FROM T1, T2
  USING T1, T2, T3
  WHERE <condition>

  // Delete actors who have a Twitter account
  // Remove Twitter account info from DigitalAssets
  DELETE Actors, DigitalAssets
  FROM Actors
  INNER JOIN DigitalAssetes
  ON Actors.Id = DigitalAssets.ActorId
  WHERE AssetType = "Twitter";

  // New syntax alternative
  DELETE FROM Actors, DigitalAssets
  USING Actors
  INNER JOIN DigitalAssets
  ON Actors.Id = DigitalAssets.ActorId
  WHERE AssetType = "Twitter";

  // Failure
  // MySQL disallows row deletion if same table also appears in SELECT clause
  DELETE Actors
  FROM Actors
  WHERE EXISTS ( SELECT *
                FROM Actors
                INNER JOIN DigitalAssets
                ON Id = ActorId
                WHERE AssetType = "Twitter");

  // Working, rewrite as correlated query
  DELETE Actors
  FROM Actors
  WHERE EXISTS (SELECT *
                FROM DigitalAssets
                WHERE ActorId = Id AND AssetType = "Twitter")

  // Remove Johnny Depp from Actors table
  // Remove his accounts from DigitalAssets except Pinterest
  DELETE Actors, DigitalAssets
  FROM Actors, DigitalAssets
  WHERE ActorId = Id
  AND FirstName = "Johnny"
  AND AssetType != "Pinterest";

  // Cannot use ORDER BY and LIMIT on multi-table deletes
