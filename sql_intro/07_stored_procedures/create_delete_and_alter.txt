  // Let's create a stored procedure ShowActors that shows all in db
  DELIMITER **
  CREATE PROCEDURE ShowActors()
  BEGIN
  SELECT * FROM Actors;
  END **
  DELIMITER;

  // By default ";" used to separte two statements
  // Stored procedure can have multiple statements ending with semicolon
  // DELIMITER keyword used to redefine the delimiter as **
  // Now can pass whole stored procedure with multiple statements
  // Use redefined delimiter "**" to end after END
  // Reset DELIMITER back to ";"" after
  // Body of procedure is a simple select statement

  // Now to use procedure
  // Same thing as executing a query
  CALL ShowActors;

  // Output is massive...
  SHOW PROCEDURE STATUS;

  // Use a WHERE clause to view stored procedures of specific database - still copious
  SHOW PROCEDURE STATUS WHERE db = 'MovieIndustry';

  // information_schema database contains data about all stored procedures
  // This will list 26 procedures
  SELECT routine_name
  FROM information_schema.routines
  WHERE routine_type = 'PROCEDURE'
  AND routine_schema = 'sys';

  // Delete procedure - IF EXISTS optional
  DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS ShowActors;

  // No way to directly modify procedure param list or body
  // Delete procedure, then recreate
