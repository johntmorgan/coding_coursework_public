What are Stored Procedures?
  Simple way to save queries for later access
  Can be defined as a set of SQL statements stored in MySQL server
  Ex.
    SELECT STATEMENT that returns all male actors
  Invoke using a CALL statement
  MySQL compiles code of procedure, stores in cache
    Call same stored procedure, execute previously compiled code
  Why good
    Reduce traffic between apps & server
      Send name of procedure, not full query
    Reduces code duplication
      Call by other procedures
    Performance gains
      Pre-compile code instead of parsing query every time
    Security
      Give users access to certain procedures, not entire tables
  Limitations
    Difficult to debug
      Automatically executed
      No checkpoints in code allowed
    Resource overhead
      May overuse memory, CPU
    No way to rollback a change to a stored procedure
