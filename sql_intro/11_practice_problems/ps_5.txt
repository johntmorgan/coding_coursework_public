1. Calculate the running total of the revenue generated per week for the first 10 weeks
  for the movie Avengers.

  SELECT T1.Weekend, T1.RevenueInMillions, SUM(T2.RevenueInMillions) AS RunningTotal
  FROM MovieScreening T1
  INNER JOIN MovieScreening T2
  ON T1.MovieId = T2.MovieId
  AND T1.Weekend >= T2.Weekend
  WHERE T1.MovieId = 10
  GROUP BY T1.Weekend
  ORDER BY T1.Weekend;

2. Calculate the total revenue of each Genre and find the percentage of revenue of each.
  CREATE VIEW CollectionPerGenre AS
  SELECT Genre, SUM(CollectionInMillions) AS TotalRevenueInMillions
  FROM Movies
  GROUP BY Genre
  ORDER BY SUM(CollectionInMillions) DESC;

  SELECT T1.Genre, T1.TotalRevenueInMillions,
         SUM(T2.TotalRevenueInMillions) AS RunningTotal
  FROM CollectionPerGenre T1
  INNER JOIN CollectionPerGenre T2
  WHERE T1.TotalRevenueInMillions <= T2.TotalRevenueInMillions
  GROUP BY T1.Genre, T1.TotalRevenueInMillions
  ORDER BY T1.TotalRevenueInMillions DESC;

  SELECT  d1.Genre AS Genre,
          d1.TotalRevenueInMillions AS TotalRevenueInMillions,
          (d1.RunningTotal / d2.TotalSum) * 100 AS PercentageOfTotalRevenues
  FROM
    (SELECT T1.Genre as Genre,
           T1.TotalRevenueInMillions AS TotalRevenueInMillions,
           SUM(T2.TotalRevenueInMillions) AS RunningTotal
    FROM CollectionPerGenre T1
    INNER JOIN CollectionPerGenre T2
    WHERE T1.TotalRevenueInMillions <= T2.TotalRevenueInMillions
    GROUP BY T1.Genre, T1.TotalRevenueInMillions
    ORDER BY T1.TotalRevenueInMillions DESC ) d1,
  ( SELECT SUM(TotalRevenueInMillions) AS TotalSum
    FROM CollectionPerGenre) d2;

3. Calculate the moving average of revenue generated in a three week window for the movie Oceanâ€™s 11.
  SELECT table1.Weekend AS Weekend,
   table1.RevenueInMillions AS Revenue,
   SUM(table2.RevenueInMillions) AS 3WeekTotal,
   AVG(table2.RevenueInMillions) AS 3WeekAverage
  FROM (
   SELECT @counter1 := @counter1+ 1 AS RowNum,
          T1.Weekend, T1.RevenueInMillions
   FROM MovieScreening T1, (SELECT @counter1 := 0) c1
   WHERE MovieId=5
   ORDER BY T1.Weekend ) AS table1
   JOIN
   (SELECT @counter2 := @counter2 + 1 AS RowNum,
           T2.Weekend, T2.RevenueInMillions
    FROM MovieScreening T2, (SELECT @counter2 := 0) c2
    WHERE MovieId=5
    ORDER BY T2.Weekend ) AS table2
    ON table2.RowNum <= table1.RowNum AND table2.RowNum > table1.RowNum - 3
  GROUP BY table1.RowNum, table1.Weekend, table1.RevenueInMillions
  HAVING COUNT(table1.RowNum) > 2;

4. Find the value of RevenueInMillions at the start of each month for the movie Mr. & Mrs. Smith.
  SELECT Weekend As Date, MONTH(Weekend) As Month,
    ROUND(RevenueInMillions,2) As RevenueInMillions, FirstValue
  FROM MovieScreening t1,
   (SELECT MONTH(Weekend) AS Month,
      SUBSTRING_INDEX(GROUP_CONCAT(ROUND(RevenueInMillions,2)),  ',' , 1) AS FirstValue
    FROM MovieScreening
    WHERE MovieId = 2
    GROUP BY MONTH(Weekend) ) t2
  WHERE t1.MovieId = 2 AND MONTH(t1.Weekend) = t2.Month;
