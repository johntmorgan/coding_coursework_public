Truncate
  A faster way to delete all the rows from your table
  Drops and recreates table
  MySQL does not count the number of rows affected - so may show wrong number here

  TRUNCATE Actors;

  Does not work with locking or transactions
  Is the equivalent of DELETE when used on InnoDB tables
    (InnoDB is a specific database engine, we'll discuss in future)
