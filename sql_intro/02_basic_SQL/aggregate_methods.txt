Aggregate functions

  // Output number of rows in table - output is single value, not rows
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Actors;

  // Add up numeric value of column
  SELECT SUM(NetworthInMillions) FROM Actors;

  // Get average numeric value of column
  SELECT AVG(NetWorthInMillions) FROM Actors;

  // Get min value, max value - also work for non-numeric columns
  SELECT MIN(NetWorthInMillions) FROM Actors;
  SELECT MAX(NetWorthInMillions) FROM Actors;

  SELECT MAX(FirstName) FROM Actors;
  SELECT MIN(FirstName) FROM Actors;

  // And finally standard deviations
  SELECT STDDEV(NetWorthInMillions) FROM Actors;
