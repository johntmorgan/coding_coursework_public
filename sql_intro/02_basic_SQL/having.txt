Having
  Filter groups
  Can also be used to filter rows
    Not intended
    Slower query
  Should be used to decide which rows for which group
  Remember it works on groups of rows
    (WHERE works on individual rows by contrast)

  // Only see single, divorced - avg net worth < 250 and avg net worth > 450
  SELECT MaritalStatus, AVG(NetworthInMillions) AS NetWorth
  FROM Actors
  GROUP BY MaritalStatus
  HAVING NetWorth > 450 OR NetWorth < 250;

  // If using column/expression in HAVING not in SELECT, probably should be using WHERE
  // This does work though
  SELECT MaritalStatus, AVG(NetworthInMillions) AS NetWorth
  FROM Actors
  GROUP BY MaritalStatus
  HAVING MaritalStatus='Married';

  // But this is better
  SELECT MaritalStatus, AVG(NetworthInMillions) AS NetWorth
  FROM Actors
  WHERE MaritalStatus="Married"
  GROUP BY MaritalStatus;
