    // "NOT is a unary operator that negates a boolean statement"
  SELECT * FROM Actors WHERE NOT NetWorthInMillions = 200;
    // Returns everyone without exactly 200 net worth
  SELECT * FROM Actors WHERE (NOT NetWorthInMillions) = 200;
    // Returns nobody - tricky!
    // Applying NOT on a non-zero column makes it zero
    // Would still not return anyone with a net worth of zero
      NOT of zero is non-zero, which is not equal to 200
  // XOR operator supported
  SELECT * FROM Actors WHERE FirstName > "B" XOR NetWorthInMillions > 200;
