Group By
  Sorts rows together into groups
  Returns one row for each group
  Data is organized using a comma separated list of columns after GROUP BY
  Often used with aggregate functions like COUNT etc.
  Must appear after FROM and WHERE
    Evaluated after too
    Evaluated before ORDER BY, LIMIT, HAVING

  SELECT FirstName FROM Actors GROUP BY FirstName;

  // Fails
  // Nonsensical to associate any one value for SecondName with entire group
  SELECT FirstName, SecondName FROM Actors GROUP BY FirstName;

  // Cannot have non-aggregated columns in SELECT, ORDER BY, HAVING clauses when do not appear in GROUP BY
    Exception when non-aggregated col has single value
    Set sql_mode to only_full_group_by
      Can unset and redo failed qury
      But value chosen for SecondName is arbitrary

  // Find number of male and female actors
  SELECT Gender, COUNT(*) FROM Actors GROUP BY Gender;

  // Find average wealth of actors of a specific marital status
  SELECT MaritalStatus, AVG(NetworthInMillions) FROM Actors GROUP BY MaritalStatus ORDER BY MaritalStatus ASC;
