Alias
  Temp name given to a table or col

  SELECT FirstName AS PopularName from Actors;

  // Use Concat to print full name
  SELECT CONCAT(FirstName,' ', SecondName) AS FullName FROM Actors;

  // Not just cosmetic, can use in queries
  SELECT CONCAT(FirstName,' ', SecondName) AS FullName FROM Actors ORDER BY FullName;

  // Equivalent query but verbose
  SELECT CONCAT(FirstName,' ', SecondName) FROM Actors ORDER BY CONCAT(FirstName,' ', SecondName);

  // Can use in GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY
  // Can use as shorthand for tables - super useful when doing joins
  SELECT FirstName FROM Actors AS tbl WHERE tbl.FirstName='Brad' AND tbl.NetWorthInMillions > 200;

  // Use table alias in SELECT clause before defining
  SELECT tbl.FirstName FROM Actors AS tbl WHERE tbl.FirstName='Brad' AND tbl.NetWorthInMillions > 200;

  // Find two rows with the same value, and not matched to self
  SELECT t1.FirstName, t1.NetworthInMillions
  FROM Actors AS t1,
  Actors AS t2
  WHERE t1.NetworthInMillions = t2.NetworthInMillions
  AND t1.Id != t2.Id;
