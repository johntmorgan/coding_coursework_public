Relational vs. non-relational
  Let's explain some jargon

Data
  Plural of datum
  Distinct pieces of information
    Numbers, text, byes, IG pics, YT vids
  Usually interpreted in a context
  3 broad categories
    Structured
    Unstructured
    Semi-structured

Structured Data
  Has predefined organizational property
    Easily searchable and analyzable
  Data backed by model that dictates the size of each field of the data
    Type
    Length
    Restrictions
  Data stored in SQL DBs is structured
    Schema formally specifies, usually
  Working with any variant of SQL almost always = structured

Unstructured
  Lack of organization
  Data model describes structure of single record or attributes of any individual fields in record
  Ex
    Video
    Audio
    Blogs
    Log files
    Social media posts

Semi-structured
  Cross between structured and unstructured
  No explicit data model or structure definition
    One may be implied
  Contains semantic tags
  Does not conform to the structure assoc. with trad. relational databases
  Ex.
    JSON
    XML
    Video & audio file metadata
    Medical scan metadata
      Most unstructured data has metadata these days!
      What's the diff between semi-structured and unstructured
        Even "unstructured" like social media posts often semi-structured

DBMS
  MySQL, PostgreSQL
  Software to create, maintain, delete multiple databases

Database
  Organized and structured collection of data
  Store and retrieve electronically
  Structure helps in efficient retrieval
  Broadly 2 types
    Relational/SQL - our focus here
    Non-Relational/NoQSQL

Relational/SQL
  Data stored as rows in tables
  Columns follow rigidly defined schema
    Type and size of data
  Schema
    Blueprint of what each row should look like
  Usually have column as key
    Uniquely identify each row in table
    Relationship between two tables defined by a column or a set of columns that occur in both the tables
  Popular techs
    Oracle
    DB2
    MS SQL Server
    PostgreSQL
    MySQL

Non-relational/NoSQL
  Rose with Web 2.0
  Data sets ever bigger
  Come in different forms for use cases
    Key-Value
      Redis
      Amazon Dynamo DB
    Column stores
      HBase
      Cassandra
    Document stores
      Mongo DB
      Couchbase
    Graph DBs
      Neo4J
    Search engines
      Solr
      ElasticSearch
      Splunk
  No rigid schema

Big Data
  NoSQL, unstructured, semi-structured
  "Big" is an evolving target with software and hardware capacities
