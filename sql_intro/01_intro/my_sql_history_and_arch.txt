  Has been revised several times
  Various implementations of standard
  Standard = blueprint
  Implementations = MySQL, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, etc
    All similar
    All conform to same standard
    Some syntax diffs though (as I know - JM)
      Oracle RDBMS, IBM DB2, MS SQL Server, Teradata, MySQL
  Many companies have DBs based on this standard

MySQL
  Consists of diff components
  Based on client-server architecture
  Website, MySQL command line connect & interact with DB thru MySQL server
  Server responds to queries from clients
  3 layers
    App/client layer
    MySQL Server Layer
    Storage Engine Layer

App/Client layer
  Client connections
  Authorization
  Authentication
  Security

MySQL Server Layer
  Parse, analyze, optimize submitted queries
  Maintains caches & buffers
  Recovery and backup partitioning
  SQL interface for interaction with database
  "Relational engine"
  Output = query execution plan fed into storage engine

Storage Engine Layer
  Part of DBMS that actually writes & retrieves data
  With MySQL, choose from several possibilities
    Depends on use case
    Ex.
      InnoDB - foreign key constraints, transactions
      MyISAM - simpler, lacks those features, good for single-user apps
