  WITH CHECK OPTION clause used at time of view creation

  CREATE VIEW SingleActors AS
  SELECT FirstName, SecondName, DoB, Gender, MaritalStatus, NetWorthInMillions
  FROM Actors
  WHERE MaritalStatus = 'Single';

  // Create an inconsistency by insering a married actor

  INSERT INTO SingleActors (FirstName, SecondName, DoB, Gender, MaritalStatus, NetWorthInMillions)
  VALUES ('Tom', 'Hanks', '1956-07-09', 'Male', 'Married', 350)
    > Appears in table when SELECT * FROM Actors;
    > Does not appear in view SELECT * FROM SingleActors;

  // Now let's restrict - again using OR REPLACE since view already exists
  CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW SingleActors AS
  SELECT FirstName, SecondName, DoB, Gender, MaritalStatus, NetWorthInMillions
  FROM Actors
  WHERE MaritalStatus = 'Single'
  WITH CHECK OPTION;

  // Try
  INSERT INTO SingleActors (FirstName, SecondName, DoB, Gender, MaritalStatus, NetWorthInMillions)
  VALUES ('Matt', 'Damon', '1970-10-08', 'Male', 'Married', 160)
    > ERROR 1369 (HY000): CHECK OPTION failed 'MovieIndustry.SingleActors'

  // Works fine
  INSERT INTO SingleActors (FirstName, SecondName, DoB, Gender, MaritalStatus, NetWorthInMillions)
  VALUES ('Charlize', 'Theron', '1975-08-07', 'Female', 'Single', 130);
