Local & Cascaded Check
  Determine scope of rule testing when view created based on another view
  Local check restricts to only view defined
  Cascaded checks rules of all underlying views
    Default if no keywords

  // Show actors > 40
  CREATE VIEW ActorsView1 AS
  SELECT *
  FROM Actors
  WHERE TIMESTAMPDIFF(YEAR, DoB, CURDATE()) > 40;

  // No WITH CHECK OPTION
  // Insert a 20 year old into the Actors table
  INSERT INTO ActorsView1
  VALUES(DEFAULT, 'Young', 'Actress', '2000-01-01', Female, Single, 000.00)

  // Can fix above using WITH CHECK OPTION
  // Now let's crate another view with cascaded check
  CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW ActorsView2 AS
  SELECT *
  FROM ActorsView1
  WITH CASCADED CHECK OPTION;

  // Now ActorsView2 must be compatible with this view and ActorsView1
  // Let's try inserting a young actor
  INSERT INTO ActorsView2
  VALUES (DEFAULT, 'Young', 'Actor', '2000-01-01', 'Male', 'Single', DEFAULT);
    > ERROR 1369 (HY000): CHECK OPTION failed 'MovieIndustry.ActorsView2'

  // Does not work because ActorsView1 limited to 40+ year olds
  // Let's see CASCADED is scoped
  CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW ActorsView3 AS
  SELECT *
  FROM ActorsView2
  WHERE TIMESTAMPDIFF(YEAR, DoB, CURDATE()) < 50;

  // Only one in this view, Angelina Jolie between 40 and 50
  Try inserting 20 yo.
  INSERT INTO ActorsView3
  VALUES (DEFAULT, 'Young', 'Actor', '2000-01-01', 'Male', 'Single', DEFAULT);
    > ERROR 1369 (HY000): CHECK OPTION failed 'MovieIndustry.ActorsView2'

  // Nope! ActorsView3 based on ActorsView2 based on ActorsView1
    Cannot insert, ActorsView1 blocks < 40
  // What about a 60 year old?
  INSERT INTO ActorsView3
  VALUES (DEFAULT, 'Old', 'Actor', '1960-01-01', 'Male', 'Single', DEFAULT);
    > Works
    > No WITH CHECK OPTION on ActorsView3
    > Insert confirms with underlying view rule as age is > 40

Local Check
  ALTER VIEW ActorsView2 AS
  SELECT *
  FROM ActorsView1
  WITH LOCAL CHECK OPTION;

  INSERT INTO ActorsView2
  VALUES (DEFAULT, 'Young', 'Actor', '2000-01-01', 'Male', 'Single', DEFAULT);
    > Works
    > Passes (absent) age restriction on ActorsView2

  INSERT INTO ActorsView3
  VALUES (DEFAULT, 'Young', 'Actor', '2000-01-01', 'Male', 'Single', DEFAULT);
    > Works
    > Checks to ActorsView2 since AV3 has cascading
    > But stops at ActorsView2 (with no rules) since it's now local
