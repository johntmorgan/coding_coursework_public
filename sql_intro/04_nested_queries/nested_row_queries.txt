Nested Row Queries
  Return rows
  Allow outer query to match on multiple different column values
  Also now going to use WHERE instead of FROM

  // Select actors whose latest social update anywhere was the date of their birthday
  // Inner join approach
  SELECT FirstName
  FROM Actors
  INNER JOIN DigitalAssets
  ON Id=ActorId
  AND MONTH(DoB) = MONTH(LastUpdatedOn)
  AND DAY(DoB) = DAY(LastUpdatedOn);

  // Nested query approach
  // Inner query returns temp result set of several rows with 3 columns
  // Outer query lists columns from the Actors table that should be matched

  SELECT FirstName
  FROM Actors
  WHERE (Id, MONTH(DoB), DAY(DoB))
  IN (SELECT ActorId, MONTH(LastUpdatedOn), DAY(LastUpdatedOn)
      FROM DigitalAssets);

  // Nested query with FROM clause
  // Which account did Kim Kardashian most recently update?
  SELECT FirstName, AssetType, LastUpdatedOn
  FROM ACTORS
  INNER JOIN (SELECT ActorId, AssetType, LastUpdatedOn
              FROM DigitalAssets) AS tbl
  ON ActorId = Id
  WHERE FirstName = Kim
  ORDER BY LastUpdatedOn DESC LIMIT 1;
