Nested Column Queries
  When nested query returns values belonging to same column

  // List social media accounts for all actors except personal websites
    // A bit contrived, just go with it
  // Subquery returns all the enum values for column
  // ANY operator allows match with any value returned for column AssetType
  SELECT * FROM Actors
  INNER JOIN DigitalAssets ON ActorId=Id
  WHERE AssetType = ANY (SELECT DISTINCT AssetType
                         FROM DigitalAssets
                         WHERE AssetType != 'Website');

  // Simpler approach for same result
  // But it was a good demo of a nested column query
  SELECT * FROM Actors
  INNER JOIN DigitalAssets ON ActorId=Id
  WHERE AssetType != 'Website';

  // Find the names of all actors that have a FB presence
  SELECT FirstName, SecondName
  FROM Actors
  WHERE Id = ANY (SELECT ActorId
                  FROM DigitalAssets
                  WHERE AssetType = 'Facebook');

  // IN clause may be used interchangeably to rewrite
  SELECT FirstName, SecondName
  FROM Actors
  WHERE Id IN (SELECT ActorId
               FROM DigitalAssets
               WHERE AssetType = 'Facebook');

  // Operator ANY, and alias IN, match at least one value from a group of values
  // Operator ALL must match all values in group
  // In this example, net worth must be higher than all actors with names beginning with j
  SELECT FirstName, SecondName
  FROM Actors
  WHERE NetworthInMillions > ALL (SELECT NetworthInMillions
                                  FROM Actors
                                  WHERE FirstName LIKE "j%");
