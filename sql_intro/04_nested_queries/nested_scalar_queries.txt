Nested Scalar Queries
  A query within a query
  Get desired result in a single query
  Often slower but more readable & expressive than join equivalent
  May be the only way to do certain retrieval

  // Here's the basic join query
  SELECT URL AS "Brad's Insta Page"
  FROM Actors
  INNER JOIN DigitalAssets
  WHERE AssetType = "Instagram" AND FirstName = "Brad";

  // Rewritten as a nested query

  SELECT URL AS "Brad's Insta Page"
  FROM DigitalAssets
  WHERE AssetType = "Instagram" AND
  ActorId = (SELECT Id
             FROM Actors
             WHERE FirstName = "Brad");

  // You can also store the data the inner query provides
  // When a subquery returns a single value it returns a "scalar operand"
  // Query will fail if returns more than one row
    > SELECT * FROM Actors WHERE FirstName = "Brad";
    > SELECT Id FROM Actors WHERE NetWorthInMillions = 240;

  // Another example, return actor that has most recently updated any account
  // Inner join
  SELECT FirstName
  FROM Actors
  INNER JOIN DigitalAssets
  ON ActorId = Id
  WHERE LastUpdatedOn = (SELECT MAX(LastUpdatedOn)
      FROM DigitalAssets);
