Correlated queries
  A type of nested query
  Inner query references a table or column from the outer query

  // Want to know which actors have their first name as part of Twitter handle
  // Inner Join version
  SELECT FirstName
  FROM Actors
  INNER JOIN DigitalAssets
  ON Id = ActorId
  WHERE URL LIKE CONCAT("%",FirstName,"%")
  AND AssetType = "Twitter";

  // Correlated query version
  // References FirstName in WHERE even though part of Actors table, which is only in outer query
  // Legal to do this!
  // Value of FirstName for each row in Actors table provided as scalar val to inner query
  // Now using EXISTS to check for condition that is true about each actor
  // Not interested in inner query return for each actor, just if it returns
  SELECT FirstName
  FROM Actors
  WHERE EXISTS (SELECT URL
                FROM DigitalAssets
                WHERE URL LIKE CONCAT("%", FirstName, "%")
                AND AssetType = "Twitter");
