What are Triggers?
  MySQL programs automatically executed in response to an event
  Associated with tables
    Invoked when table contents change
      INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
    Can happen before or after
  Two types
    Row-level
      If 25 inserts, invoked 25 times
    Statement-level
      If 25 inserts, invoked once
  MySQL only supports row-level triggers

Why triggers?
  Prevent invalid DML statements from executing
  Handle errors from DB layer ensuring data integrity
  Alternative to scheduled events
    Happen whenever DML statement executed
  Good for auditing changes, keeping a log of changes

Limitations
  Increased server overhead
  Difficult to debug
    Run automatically at DB layer
    Not possible to apply breakpoints and see step by step execution
  Do not provide all validations needed at app layer
  Can only be associated with
    INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
    e.g. TRUNCATE will not invoke a DELETE trigger
