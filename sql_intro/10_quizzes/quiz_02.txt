// Partial indexes
  Partial indexes are also known as filtered indexes and include only a subset of
  rows of a table rather than the entire table. The rows are selected for
  indexing based on some specified condition.

// Clustered indexes
  In case of clustered index, the table is itself stored on disk as an index,
  usually, as a B+ tree. Whereas, in the case of a non-clustered index, the
  table is stored in the order as the rows are inserted and any declared
  indexes exist as separate data-structures on the disk.
