1. b is a column name in this statement
CREATE VIEW a (b) AS SELECT c FROM d;

2.
CREATE VIEW A AS
    SELECT num
    FROM xyz
    WHERE num > 10;

CREATE VIEW B AS
    SELECT num
    FROM A
    WHERE num<20
    WITH CHECK OPTION;

INSERT INTO B (num)
VALUES (5);

// Fails because view A condition blocks - WITH CHECK OPTION defaults to cascading

3. About WITH CHECK OPTION

The WITH CHECK OPTION clause prevents inserts of rows for which the WHERE clause
in the select_statement is not true.

The WITH CHECK OPTION clause prevents updates to rows for which the WHERE clause
is true but the update would cause it to be not true

4. ALGORITHM can take 1 of 3 values - MERGE, TEMPTABLE, UNDEFINE

  CREATE ALGORITHM=MERGE VIEW ActorView(
     Id, firstName, lastName, birthday) AS
  SELECT 
     ActorId, FirstName, LastName, Dob
  FROM Actors;

  SELECT * FROM ActorView
  WHERE lastname < 'J';

  // MySQL will combine the input query with the SELECT statement of the view definition
    into a single query and execute the query to get the result.
