1. Which MySQL statement will delete a table from database and free space in memory
while keeping the structure of the table intact?

  TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;

2. Consider the following queries which give the same result. Pick the most efficient.

  // Good
  // Select non-overlapping subsets of rows
  // Avoid expensive DISTINCT
  SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE col1 = x
  UNION ALL
  SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE col2 = y AND col1 != x;

  // Bad:
  // If index on col1, then full-table scan on col2
  SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE col1 = x OR col2 = y;

  // Bad:
  // DISTINCT is expensive because sorts rows to find duplicates
  SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE col1 = x
  UNION DISTINCT
  SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE col2 = y;

3. Which MySQL function assigns a sequential number to each row of table starting with 1
  ROW_NUMBER()

4. Suppose you perform an UPSERT i.e. a conditional update or insertion into a table.
