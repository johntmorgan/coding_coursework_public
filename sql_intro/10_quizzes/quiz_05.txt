1.
WHERE myColumn = NULL

vs.

WHERE myColumn IS NULL

// NULL is a special value, can't use with = or other comparison operators
// Not the same, should always use IS NULL or IS NOT NULL

2.
// Outcome of query where SomeTable exists

SELECT "Hello"
FROM SomeTable
WHERE NULL = NULL;

// Nothing is printed, NULL must be tested with IS or IS NOT

3.
// Can a table have multiple clustered index
  No, clustered index is the table itself

4. Disadvantages of foreign key
  Slows down write queries - must verify each honors constraint

5. When does REPLACE behave exactly like INSERT
  When table has no primary and unique index defined on it
