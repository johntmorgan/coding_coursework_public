1. Bad idea to add or drop col from very large table
  Causes table to be rebuilt, very expensive

2. RIGHT JOIN and LEFT JOIN same for self join of table

  NULL

3.
SELECT * FROM
A RIGHT JOIN B
ON A.col = B.col;

// Same as

SELECT * FROM
B LEFT JOIN A
ON A.col = B.col;

4.
Consider the query:

REPLACE INTO Actors(ActorId, FirstName, SecondName)
VALUES(13, 'Will', 'Smith');

A trigger xyz associated with Actors table is fired when REPLACE is executed.

// The MySQL REPLACE statement inserts the row if there is no duplicate key error,
  otherwise it deletes the row causing the error before inserting the new row.
  An INSERT trigger will be fired when REPLACE statement is executed.

5.
Consider the query:

TRUNCATE TABLE Actors;

A trigger xyz associated with Actors table is fired when TRUNCATE is executed.

// No triggers are fired because TRUNCATE is a sequence of DROP TABLE and
  CREATE TABLE statements. It does not use DELETE statement so, a delete trigger
  associated with the table that is being truncated is not fired.
